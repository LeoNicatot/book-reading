# 1 The Research

Free voluntary reading (henceforth FVR) means reading because you want to: no book reports, no questions at the end of the chapter. In FVR, you don’t have to finish the book if you don’t like it. FVR is the kind of reading most of us do obsessively all the time.

FVR is one of the most powerful tools we have in language education, and, as I argue in this chapter, FVR is the missing ingredient in first language “language arts” as well as intermediate second and foreign language instruction. It will not, by itself, produce the highest levels of competence; rather, it provides a foundation so that higher levels of proficiency may be reached. When FVR is missing, these advanced levels are extremely difficult to attain.

In the following section, the evidence for the efficacy of FVR is briefly reviewed. Following this review, I argue that alternative means of promoting language and literacy development are not nearly as effective.

## **The Evidence for FVR**

### In-School Free Reading Programs

In-school free reading programs provide some of the clearest evidence for the power of reading. In these programs, part of the school day is set aside for unrestricted FVR. There are three kinds of in-school free reading programs: sustained silent reading, self-selected reading, and extensive reading. In sustained silent reading, both teachers and students engage in free reading for short periods each day (from five to 15 minutes; see Pilgreen 2000). In self-selected reading, free reading is a large part of the language arts program, with teachers holding conferences with students to discuss what was read. In extensive reading, a minimal amount of accountability is required, for example, a short summary of what was read.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Types of in-school FVR: sustained silent reading, self-selected reading, extensive reading.*

Table 1.1:
Results of Reading Comprehension Tests: In-School Free Reading Compared to Traditional Approaches![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00004.jpg)

[Table 1.1 ](text00005.html#tab1.1)summarizes the impact of in-school free reading programs on tests of reading comprehension. In each case, readers were compared to students in traditional programs. These were programs that emphasized assigned reading and direct instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and spelling.

Two findings clearly emerge from this table: First, in-school free reading programs are consistently effective. In 51 out of 54 comparisons (94 percent), readers do as well as or better than students who were engaged in traditional programs.

Note that a finding of “no difference” between free readers and students in traditional programs suggests that free reading is just as good as tradi-tional instruction, which confirms that free reading results in literacy growth, an important theoretical point we return to later. As we will see later, there is also strong evidence that free reading is extremely pleasant and results in superior general knowledge. Even if free reading were equivalent to direct instruction in terms of literacy development, it should therefore be the preferred option.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *In 51 out of 54 comparisons, students using FVR did as well as or better on reading tests than students given traditional skill-based reading instruction.*

Second, studies that last longer show more consistently positive results. One reason for this finding is apparent to teachers who have used free reading in their classrooms: It takes a while for students to select a book. [Table 1.1 ](text00005.html#tab1.1)suggests that programs that last longer than a year are consistently effective.[ 1](text00005.html#fn1)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The longer FVR is done, the more consistent the results.*

In-school free reading programs are also effective for vocabulary development, grammar test performance, writing, and oral/aural language ability (Greaney 1970; Krashen 1989).

Only a few in-school reading studies have measured gains in spelling. Of these, Pfau (1967) reported no additional gains in spelling due to supplementary free reading, but Collins (1980) and Hafiz and Tudor (1990) found that those who participated in sustained silent reading made better progress in spelling than those who were in a traditional instruction program. Elley (1991) reports a split-decision: In one group, those who did in-school free reading made better progress in spelling than traditionally taught students, but in another comparison with different students, there was no difference. In no case, however, did traditionally taught students do better.[ 2](text00005.html#fn2)

Some examples illustrate the findings of in-school free reading. Much of the research summarized in [table 1.1 ](text00005.html#tab1.1)was performed on first lan-guage acquirers in elementary school in the United States. The results of the following studies showthat free reading is very effective with other groups as well.

McNeil, in Fader (1976), examined the effects of a free reading program on 60 reform school boys, ages 12–17. The boys were encouraged to read newspapers, magazines, and softcover books, and the reading material was the basis for classroom discussions. After one year, the readers increased their reading comprehension scores (Scholastic Achievement Test) from 69.9 to 82.7 (a gain of 12.8), while comparisons only improved from 55.8 to 60.4 (a gain of 4.6).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Reform-school boys benefited from FVR.*

Elley and Mangubhai (1983) showed that free reading has a dramatic effect on second language acquirers. In their study, fourth- and fifth-grade students of English as a foreign language were divided into three groups for their 30-minute daily English class. One group had traditional audio-lingual method instruction, a second did only free reading, while a third did “shared reading,” Shared reading “is a method of sharing a good book with a class, several times, in such a way that the students are read to by the teacher, as in a bedtime story. They then talk about the book, they read it together, they act out the story, they draw parts of it and write their own caption, they rewrite the story with different characters or events” (Elley 1998, pp. 1–2). After two years, the free reading group and the shared reading group were far superior to the traditional group in tests of reading comprehension, writing, and grammar.

Elley (1991) also showed that free reading had a profound effect on second language acquirers in Singapore. In three studies involving a total of ap-proximately 3,000 children, ages six though nine, and lasting from one to three years, children who followed the “Reading and English Acquisition Program,” a combination of shared book experience, language experience, and free reading (“book flood”), outperformed traditionally taught students on tests of reading comprehension, vocabulary, oral language, grammar, listening comprehension, and writing.[ 3](text00005.html#fn3)

Elley’s more recent data (Elley 1998) come from South Africa and Sri Lanka. In all cases, children who were encouraged to read for pleasure outperformed traditionally taught students on standardized tests of reading comprehension and other measures of literacy. [Table 1.2](text00005.html#tab1.2)presents the data from South Africa. In this study, EFL students who lived in print-poor environments were given access to sets of 60 high-interest books, which were placed in classrooms, with another 60 made available in sets of six identical titles. The books were used for read-alouds by the teacher, shared reading, and silent reading. [Table 1.2 ](text00005.html#tab1.2)presents data from different provinces; in every case the readers outperformed those in comparison classes, and the gap widened with each year of reading.

*Source* : Mason and Krashen (1997)

Beniko Mason’s studies show that in-school extensive reading works very well for older students studying English as a foreign language. In Mason’s first study (included in Mason and Krashen 1997), experimental students were taking a required English as a foreign language class at the college level in Japan. It was, however, a special class, consisting exclusively of students who had previously failed English (termed Sai Rishu, or retakers). Students were pre- and posttested with a cloze test, which required them to fill in missing words in an English text. For one semester, students in the experimental class read graded readers, both in class and as homework. There was some “accountability” in these classes, but it was minimal: Students had to write short synopses and keep a diary in Japanese, recording their feelings, opinions, and progress. Students in the comparison classes followed the traditional grammar and translation-based curriculum.

As presented in [table 1.3 ](text00005.html#tab1.3), even though the extensive readers started the semester with much lower test scores in English reading, they made larger gains than the traditional group and nearly caught up with them by the end of the semester.

| Traditional       | 29.70 (8.23)      | 33.05 (8.24)        |

Perhaps the most important and impressive finding of this study is the clear improvement in at-titude shown by the students who did extensive reading. Many of the once reluctant students of English became eager readers. Several wrote in their diaries that they were amazed at their improvement. Their diaries also indicated that they understood the stories. Also of interest is Mason’s observation that students did not progress linearly from easy to hard books. Some students read easy books after reading some more difficult texts, and then returned later to harder books.

In subsequent studies, Mason showed that extensive reading was superior to traditional instruction in programs lasting for a full academic year for both university and community college students. She also demonstrated that extensive readers improve in writing as well as reading (Mason and Krashen 1997).

Shin (2001) examined the impact of a six-week self-selected reading experience among 200 sixth graders who had to attend summer school because of low reading proficiency. About 30 percent of each group were limited English proficient. Students attended class four hours per day; during this time, approximately two hours were devoted to self-selected reading, including 25 minutes in the school library. The district invested $25 per student on popular paperbacks and magazines, with most books purchased from the *Goosebumps* series. In addition, about 45 minutes per day was devoted to reading and discussing novels such as Wilson Rawl’s *Where the Red Fern Grows* and Scott O’Dell’s *The Island of the Blue Dolphins* . Comparison children followed a standard language arts curriculum during the summer.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) Goosebumps *summer was successful* .

The readers gained approximately five months on the Altos test of reading comprehension and vocabulary over the six-week period, while comparisons declined. On the Nelson-Denny reading comprehension test, the summer readers grew well over one year. On the vocabulary section, however, the groups showed equivalent gains.

In view of the many recent moves to force less proficient readers to go to summer school to increase their reading ability, Shin’s program clearly offers a more pleasant and more effective alternative to the usual diet of drills and exercises.[ 4](text00005.html#fn4)

### Reported Free Voluntary Reading

People who say they read more typically read better and have a more mature writing style. As is the case with in-school free reading, this result has been confirmed in many studies (for a detailed review, see Krashen 1988). I present here only a few examples.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Those who say they read more read and write better.*

Anderson, Wilson, and Fielding (1988) asked fifth graders to record their activities outside of school and reported that “among all the ways children spend their time, reading books was the best predictor of several measures of reading achievement (reading comprehension, vocabulary, and reading speed), including gains in reading comprehension between second and fifth grade” (p. 285).

Postlethwaite and Ross (1992) studied schools in 32 countries whose nine-year-olds did especially well in reading, controlling for books in the home and other background factors. Of 150 possible pre-dictors of high reading scores, free reading came in second: Students in schools in which there was more reading of books, magazines, and comics read better. The third best predictor was the amount of reading time in class.

Kim (2003) reported similar results for summer reading for a group of children who had just completed grade five. In a careful study in which he statistically controlled for a wide variety of other factors (including gender, poverty, ethnicity, attitude/motivation, and whether the child was emotionally disturbed, learning disabled, or a speaker of English as a second language), those who read more over the summer made significantly greater gains in reading comprehension. Kim calculated that reading one book over the summer was associated with a .03 standard deviation gain in reading comprehension; thus, reading five books is associated with a .15 standard deviation gain (about 3 NCE units). If such gains are cumulative, that is, if they could be repeated each summer, the impact is very substantial, even if only a modest amount of additional reading is done.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Five extra books over the summer=3 percentiles gain.*

Studies also show a relationship between reports of amount read and spelling performance (for first language acquisition, Stanovich and West 1989; for second language acquisition, Polak and Krashen 1988), and a positive relationship between reported free reading and writing ability in Chinese has been demonstrated by Lee and Krashen (1996, 1997) and Lee (2001).

### Reported Free Reading in a Second Language

Studies in both second and foreign language confirm that those who read more do better on a wide variety of tests.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *FVR and the Spanish subjunctive.*

In Stokes, Krashen, and Kartchner (1998), stu-dents of Spanish as a foreign language in the United States were tested on their knowledge of the subjunctive, a verb form that students of Spanish usually find very difficult to master. The test used probed subjects’ ability to actually use the subjunctive in a real situation, not simply whether they knew the rule. In fact, only subjects who were not aware that the subjunctive was the focus of the test were included in the analysis. The only significant predictor of the ability to use the subjunctive was the amount of free voluntary reading done in Spanish; the amount of formal study of Spanish, the amount of formal study specifically aimed at the subjunctive, and how long subjects had lived in a Spanish-speaking country were not significant predictors of subjunctive competence.

Similar results for mastery of the English relative clause were reported for international students living in the United States (Lee, Krashen, and Gribbons 1996).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *FVR and the English relative clause.*

Several studies confirm that those who read more in their second language also write better in that language (Salyer 1987; Janopoulous 1986; Kaplan and Palhinda 1981).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *FVR and the TOEFL.*

The amount of free reading reported is also a very good predictor of performance on the TOEFL examination, the test of academic English that international students take that assesses their competence in listening comprehension, grammar, and writing, in addition to reading comprehension. The relationship between free reading and TOEFL scores has been demonstrated by studies done with those taking the test abroad (Gradman and Hanania 1991) as well as those living in the United States (Constantino, Lee, Cho, and Krashen 1997): Those who reported more “extracurricular read-ing” (Gradman and Hanania) and “free reading” and “book reading” (Constantino et al.) scored higher on the TOEFL. Of great interest is the finding that the amount of “extracurricular writing” done was not a significant predictor of TOEFL scores (Gradman and Hanania).

The relationship between reported free voluntary reading and literacy development is not large in every study, but it is remarkably consistent. Nearly every study that has examined this relationship has found a positive correlation, and it is present even when different tests, different methods of probing reading habits, and different definitions of free reading are used.

Although the results of reported free voluntary reading studies are impressive, there are some problems with this research. First, the studies rely on how much reading people say they do, which may or may not be accurate. Second, one can imagine other factors that could have been responsible for literacy development. Perhaps those who read more also did other things, such as vocabulary exercises, or perhaps those who did more drills and exercises in school did better on reading tests and also became better readers and thus read more. I think these possibilities are far-fetched, but they are possible.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Other explanations for literacy development are possible but not plausible.*

One could also argue that the in-school free reading studies discussed earlier also have this problem—maybe the additional reading inspired students to do more drills and exercises. This is also unlikely, but it is possible.

### The Author Recognition Test

Keith Stanovich, in a series of studies, has verified the value of a simple procedure for studying the impact of reading. In the author recognition test, subjects simply indicate whether they recognize the names of authors on a list. For speakers of English as a first language, scores on the author recognition test have been shown to correlate substantially with measures of vocabulary (West and Stanovich 1991; West, Stanovich, and Mitchell 1993; Lee, Krashen, and Tse 1997), reading comprehension (Cipielewski and Stanovich 1990; Stanovich and West 1989), and spelling (Cunningham and Stanovich 1990). These results have been confirmed using other first languages as well: Significant correlations have been reported between performance on an author recognition test and writing performance in Chinese (Lee and Krashen 1996), and Korean (Kim and Krashen 1998a), and between author recognition test performance and vocabulary development in Spanish (Rodrigo, McQuillan, and Krashen 1996).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Those who recognize more authors’ names have read more and have superior literacy development.*

Those who report reading more also do better on the author recognition test. This is true for English speakers (Stanovich and West 1989; Allen, Cipielewski, and Stanovich 1992), Korean speakers (Kim and Krashen 1998a), Chinese speakers (Lee and Krashen 1996), and Spanish speakers (Rodrigo et al. 1996).

One study also reported a positive correlation between performance on the author recognition test and the amount of reading subjects were observed doing. West, Stanovich, and Mitchell (1993) observed airport passengers waiting for flights and classified them as either readers (those who were observed to be reading for at least 10 continuous minutes) or nonreaders. Readers did significantly better on an author recognition test as well as a short vocabulary recognition test.

Only one study thus far has examined the performance of foreign language students on the au-thor recognition test. Kim and Krashen (1998b) reported that for high school students of English as a foreign language, performance on an English author recognition test was a good predictor of performance on an English vocabulary test. In addition, those who reported more free reading in English also tended to do better on the author recognition test.

In addition to providing confirmation of the relation between recreational reading and language development, the author recognition test and similar measures (magazine recognition test, title recognition test) promise to simplify work in this area.

### Read and Test Studies

Read and test studies also provide evidence for the power of reading. In read and test studies, subjects read passages containing words whose meanings are unfamiliar to them. Readers are not alerted to the presence of these words in the text, nor are they told that a vocabulary or spelling test will be given after they read the text. Rather, readers are encouraged to read the passage for its meaning. After they finish reading the passage, they are tested to see if they have acquired some or all of the meanings of the unfamiliar words or if their spelling of these words has improved. Read and test studies thus probe “incidental” learning.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Read and test studies utilize passages with unfamiliar words in context.*

Some of the most important read and test studies were done at the University of Illinois (Nagy, Herman, and Anderson 1985; Nagy, An-derson, and Herman 1987). The Illinois researchers used elementary school students as subjects and passages from elementary school textbooks as texts. Their measures of vocabulary knowledge had an important feature: They were sensitive to whether subjects had acquired just part of the meaning of a target word. Nagy et al. (1985) concluded from their data that when an unfamiliar word was seen in print, “a small but reliable increase of word knowledge” typically occurred (Nagy and Herman 1987, p. 26).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Each time an unfamiliar word is read in context, a small increase in word knowledge typically occurs.*

#### *The Clockwork Orange Study*

The Clockwork Orange study (Saragi, Nation, and Meister 1978) provides a powerful demonstration of our ability to acquire vocabulary by reading. In this study, adult readers (native speakers of English) were asked to read *A Clockwork Orange* by Anthony Burgess, a novel that contains 241 words from a slang called nadsat. Each nadsat word is repeated an average of 15 times. Few readers know these words before reading the book. The versions of *A Clockwork Orange* sold in bookstores have a dictionary in the back, so readers can look up the meanings of the nadsat words.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Students who read a novel with many unique words actually acquired the meaning of many of those words from context clues alone.*

In this study, subjects were simply asked to read *A Clockwork Orange* and were told that after they finished it, they would be given a test of comprehension and literary criticism. They were not told to try to learn or remember the nadsat words. What is crucial is that they were given copies of the book without the dictionary in the back. The subjects read the book on their own time and reported finishing it in three days or less. A few days later, subjects were given a multiple-choice test covering 90 of the nadsat words.

A great deal of vocabulary acquisition took place. Scores ranged from 50 percent to 96 percent correct, with an average of 76 percent—subjects picked up at least 45 words, simply by reading a novel.

Second language read and test studies confirming that vocabulary can be acquired by reading include Pitts, White, and Krashen (1989); Day, Omura and Hiramatsu (1991); Dupuy and Krashen (1993); Horst, Cobb, and Meara (1998); and Pulido (2003). In Hermann (2003), two groups of adult ESL students were tested on unknown words contained in *Animal Farm* . One group memorized the list by rote; the second read the book. The readers were not aware they would be tested on vocabulary. When tested after one week, those who memorized the list did better, but after three weeks there was no difference between the groups. Those who did rote memorization forgot words between the two tests, but the readers actually improved their scores.[ 5](text00005.html#fn5)

It is clear that some contexts give the reader better clues to the meaning of a word than others do. Nevertheless, research indicates that most contexts are helpful; Beck, McKeown, and McCaslin (1983) found that 61 percent of the contexts they examined in basal readers were of help in acquiring new vocabulary, providing at least some clues to meanings of unfamiliar words, while 31 percent were of no help and 8 percent were “misdirective.”

Despite the presence of occasionally unhelpful or misdirective contexts, readers eventually arrive at meanings of many unknown words. The few that escape readers, the few that must be looked up or that readers get completely wrong, are a tiny minority compared to the enormous number successfully acquired.[ 6](text00005.html#fn6)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Most contexts are “helpful.”*

#### *Spelling*

Spelling read and test studies yield similar results (see Krashen 1989 for a detailed review). Each time readers read a passage containing words they cannot spell, they make a small amount of progress in acquiring the correct spelling.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Reading improves spelling.*

Nisbet’s study (1941) is typical. Children ages 11 to 14 read passages containing words they could not spell correctly on a pretest. After reading the passage, the children could spell an average of about one out of 25 of these words. Nisbet found this figure unimpressive and concluded that “intensive reading and study of a passage…does lead to some learning of spelling, but this gain is not sufficient…to justify the neglect of specific spelling instruction” (p. 11). This may, however, be enough to make a substantial contribution to spelling competence if readers read enough.[ 7](text00005.html#fn7)

The hypothesis that spelling comes from reading is confirmed by an experience familiar to all teachers: Our spelling gets worse when we read misspelled words. A modified read and test study, in fact, confirmed that “reading student essays may be hazardous to one’s spelling accuracy” (Jacoby and Hollingshead 1990, p. 357). In this study, subjects read misspelled versions of different words. Even though they read the misspelled words only once, when given a spelling test, the subjects performed significantly worse on the words they had seen misspelled than on those they had seen spelled correctly.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *If readers read misspelled words, their spelling declines as well as the confidence of the speller.*

Jacoby and Hollingshead (1990) point out that the effect of seeing an incorrectly spelled word just one time was not large. They noted, however, that

much more dramatic results were produced… by the second author of [the] paper. In the course of collecting the data…she read the incorrectly spelled words a large number of times. As a result of this extended experience with those incorrect spellings, she reports having lost confidence in her spelling accuracy. She can no longer judge spelling accuracy on the basis of a word “looking right.” The word might look right because it was one of our incorrectly spelled words, (pp. 356–357)

### Summary

In-school free reading studies and “out of school” self-reported free voluntary reading studies show that more reading results in better reading comprehension, writing style, vocabulary, spelling, and grammatical development. Read and test studies confirm that reading develops vocabulary and spelling. [Figure 1.1 ](text00005.html#fig1.1)summarizes the “reading hypothesis.”[ 8](text00005.html#fn8)

Figure 1.1 The Reading Hypothesis![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00006.jpg)

Despite these results, it could be argued that reading is only one way to develop literacy. In the following section, we examine one rival hypothe-sis, the hypothesis that literacy can be developed in another way, by direct instruction.

## **The Alternative to Free Reading: Direct Instruction**

Direct instruction can be characterized as a combination of two processes:

\1. Skill-building: Skill-building means consciously learning a rule, word meaning, or spelling and then making the rule “automatic” through output practice.

\2. Error correction: When errors are corrected, students are expected to adjust their conscious knowledge of the rule, word, or spelling.

There are several compelling reasons why direct instruction cannot account for the development of literacy. Each of these reasons, taken alone, is sufficient. Together, the case against instruction is overwhelming. Briefly, there are three arguments against instruction:

\1. Language is too vast, too complex to be taught or learned one rule or word at a time (the complexity argument).

\2. Literacy development can occur without formal instruction (competence without instruction).

\3. The impact of direct instruction is typically small or nonexistent. When studies do show an effect of instruction, the effect sometimes disappears with time.

### The Complexity Argument

Many scholars have noted that language is too complex to be deliberately and consciously learned one rule or item at a time. This argument has been made for the acquisition of grammar (Krashen 1982), spelling (Smith 1994a), phonics(Smith 1994b), writing style (Smith 1994a; Krashen 1984), and vocabulary (Smith 1988; Nagy, Herman, and Anderson 1985).

Perhaps the most concrete example is vocabulary. Estimates of adult vocabulary size range from about 40,000 (Lorge and Chall 1963) to 156,000 words (Seashore and Eckerson 1940), and it has been claimed that elementary school children acquire from eight (Nagy and Herman 1987) to more than 14 (Miller 1977) words per day.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Language is too complex to be learned one rule or word at a time.*

Not only are there many words to acquire, there are also subtle and complex properties of words that competent users have acquired. Quite often, the meaning of a word is not nearly adequately represented by a synonym. As Finegan (1999) points out, words that appear to have the same meaning often refer to slightly different concepts or are used in slightly different ways.[ 9](text00005.html#fn9)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Language users must acquire many words with many nuances of meaning and complex grammatical properties.*

Also, when we acquire a word we acquire considerable knowledge about its grammatical properties. With verbs, for example, this includes fairly straightforward properties, for example, whether they are transitive or intransitive (we can say, “John told a joke,” but not “John told.”) , as well as more complex properties, for example, the fact that in the sentence “John is easy to please,” the subject of “please” is “someone” and not John, but John is the subject of “please” in “John is eager to please.” Professional grammarians have struggled to properly describe the generalizations underlying such differences, and they are rarely taught.

Vocabulary teaching methods typically focus on teaching simple synonyms and thus give only part of the meaning of the word and none of its so-cial meanings or grammatical properties.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Teaching vocabulary lists is not efficient. The time is better spent reading.*

### Competence without Instruction

There is abundant evidence that literacy development can occur without formal instruction. Moreover, this evidence strongly suggests that reading is potent enough to do the entire job alone.

The read and test studies reviewed earlier are among the most compelling cases of literacy development without instruction. Clearly, in these cases, acquisition of vocabulary and spelling occurred without skill-building or correction.

Similarly, students in in-school free reading programs (see “In-School Free Reading Programs,” above) who made gains equal to or greater than children in traditional programs have demonstrated acquisition of literacy without direct instruction.

People with large vocabularies and good writing ability do not generally claim to have developed them through study. Smith and Supanich (1984) tested 456 company presidents and reported that they had significantly larger vocabulary scores than a comparison group of adults did. When asked if they had made an effort to increase their vocabulary since leaving school, 54.5 percent said they had. When asked what they did to increase their vocabulary, however, about half of the 54.5 percent mentioned reading. Only 14 percent of those who tried to increase their vocabulary (3 percent of the total group) mentioned the use of vocabulary books.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Only a small percentage of those with large vocabularies used increase their vocabulary books to vocabularies.*

#### *Some Case Histories*

Some impressive case histories strongly suggest that reading alone is enough. Richard Wright (1966) grew up in an environment in which read-ing and writing was disapproved of by family members; his grandmother actually burned the books he brought home, “branding them as worldly” (Wright 1966, p. 142).

Wright became interested in reading and in hearing stories at an early age, thanks to a school-teacher (a boarder at his home) who told him stories from novels. Wright struggled to gain access to reading material. He delivered newspapers only so that he could read them and used an associate’s library card to take books out of a library that was restricted to whites.

Clearly in agreement with the research reported here, Wright credits reading with providing his development as a writer: “I wanted to write and I did not even know the English language. I bought English grammars and found them dull. I felt I was getting a better sense of the language from novels than from grammars” (1966, p. 275).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Author Richard Wright attributed his language development to novels, not English grammars.*

Although Richard Wright depended, to a great extent, on fiction, Malcolm X (El-Hajj Malik El-Shabbaz) credited nonfiction with his literacy development. As he describes in his autobiography, Malcolm X had early success in school. He was, in fact, president of his seventh-grade class. His life in the streets, however, “erased everything I’d ever learned in school (El-Shabazz 1964, p. 154). He describes his first attempt to write a letter to Elijah Mohammed:

At least twenty-five times I must have written that first one-page letter to him, over and over. I was trying to make it legible and understandable. I practically couldn’t read my handwriting myself; it shames even to remember it. My spelling and grammar were as bad, if not worse (p. 169).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Malcolm X educated himself in prison by reading.*

The change came in prison. “Many who hear me today somewhere in person, or on television, or those who read something I’ve said, will think I went to school far beyond the eighth grade. This impression is due entirely to my prison studies” (p. 171).

These “prison studies” consisted largely of reading. Building his vocabulary at first the hard way, by studying the dictionary, Malcolm X became a dedicated reader: “In every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading on my bunk. You couldn’t have gotten me out of books with a wedge” (1964, p. 173).

Like Richard Wright, Malcolm X specifically gave reading the credit: “Not long ago, an English writer telephoned me from London, asking questions. One was, ‘What’s your alma mater?’ I told him, ‘Books’” (1964, p. 179).

The following cases are interesting because they confirm that language and literacy development can occur from reading in a “heritage” or family language, and in a second language. In both cases, the acquirers themselves were unaware that they had made any progress.

Segal (1997) describes the case of L., a 17-year-old 11th-grade student in Israel. L. spoke English at home with her parents, who are from South Africa, but had serious problems in English writing, especially in spelling, vocabulary, and writing style. Segal, L.’s teacher in grade 10, tried a variety of approaches:

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Summer reading caused a dramatic improvement in writing.*

Error correction proved a total failure. L. tried correcting her own mistakes, tried process writing, and tried just copying words correctly in her notebook. Nothing worked. L.’s composi-tions were poorly expressed and her vocabulary was weak. We conferenced together over format and discussed ideas before writing. We made little progress. I gave L. a list of five useful words to spell each week for six weeks and tested her in an unthreatening way during recess. L. performed well in the tests in the beginning, but by the end of six weeks she reverted to misspelling the words she have previously spelt correctly.

In addition, L.’s mother got her a private tutor, but there was little improvement.

Segal also taught L. in grade 11. At the beginning of the year, she assigned an essay:

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Summer reading caused a dramatic improvement in writing.*

When I came to L.’s composition I stopped still. Before me was an almost perfect essay. There were no spelling mistakes. The paragraphs were clearly marked. Her ideas were well put and she made good sense. Her vocabulary had improved. I was amazed but at the same time uneasy.

Segal discovered the reason for L.’s improvement: She had become a reader over the summer. L. told her, “I never read much before but this summer I went to the library and I started reading and I just couldn’t stop.” L.’s performance in grade 11 in English was consistently excellent, and her reading habit has continued.

Cohen (1997) attended an English-language medium school in her native Turkey, beginning at age 12. The first two years were devoted to intensive English study, and Cohen reports that after only two months, she started to read in English, “as many books in English as I could get hold of. I had a rich, ready made library of English books at home… I became a member of the local British Council’s li-brary and occasionally purchased English books in bookstores…. By the first year of middle school I had become an avid reader of English.”

Her reading, however, led to an “unpleasant incident” in middle school:

I had a new English teacher who assigned us two compositions for homework. She returned them to me ungraded, furious. She wanted to know who had helped me write them. They were my personal work. I had not even used the dictionary. She would not believe me. She pointed at a few underlined sentences and some vocabulary and asked me how I knew them; they were well beyond the level of the class. I had not even participated much in class. I was devastated. There and then and many years later I could not explain how I knew them. I just did.

#### *Spelling without Instruction*

There is excellent evidence that children can learn to spell without instruction. The earliest study showing this was done by Cornman (1902), who studied the effect of dropping all spelling instruction in elementary schools for three years (spelling errors were still corrected by teachers, however). Cornman concluded that the effects of spelling instruction were “negligible” and that uninstructed students continued to improve in spelling and did just as well as students in previous years’ classes and students in other schools.[ 10](text00005.html#fn10)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Several studies show children can learn to spell without instruction.*

Cornman’s results were replicated by Richards (1920), who studied 78 children in grades six, seven, and eight who went without spelling instruction for one year. Richards reported that 68 percent of these children improved more than one year in spelling, 20 percent made no change, and only 12 percent got worse. An additional replication was done by Kyte (1948), who found that “ex-cellent spellers” who were excused from spelling instruction continued to improve.

Very young children can learn to spell without instruction. Goodman and Goodman (1982) reported that their daughter Kay learned to read and spell before she came to school, without any formal instruction at home. At age six, Kay spelled 58 percent of the words on a third-grade spelling list correctly and recognized the correct spellings of 91 percent of the words.

Several researchers have found that children can spell correctly a substantial percentage of words they have not yet studied in class (Thompson 1930; Curtiss and Dolch 1939; Hughes 1966) and that children improve each year on words they have already studied (Curtiss and Dolch 1939), which is additional evidence that spelling improves without instruction.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Adults acquiring English improve their spelling without instruction.*

Haggan (1991) presented evidence suggesting that adult second language acquirers can improve their spelling without instruction. Haggan reported that fourth-year Arabic-speaking English majors at the University of Kuwait made fewer spelling errors in their writing than first-year English majors, even though little emphasis was put on “systematic, explicit teaching of spelling” (p. 59) in the curriculum.

### The Effect of Instruction

The studies reviewed earlier of in-school free reading programs show that when free reading and direct (traditional) instruction are compared directly, free reading is as good or better, and in long-term studies free reading is a consistent winner. In addition, Snow, Barnes, Chandler, Goodman, and Hemphill (1991) reported no significant correlations between the amount of explicit vocabulary instruction students had and gains in read-ing comprehension and vocabulary over four years. Snow et al. also found that the exclusive use of a basal reader or workbook in reading lessons was negatively correlated with gains in reading comprehension, but that the use of a workbook for homework was positively correlated with gains in reading comprehension, a result that conflicts with other results presented in this section.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *FVR is nearly always superior to direct instruction on tests of*

- *reading*
- *vocabulary*
- *writing*
- *grammar*

Although the research on the impact of in-school free reading on spelling was not conclusive, there is, however, extensive evidence from other sources showing that spelling instruction has little effect. Rice (1897) claimed to find no correlation between the amount of time children were instructed on spelling and their spelling performance.[ 11](text00005.html#fn11)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Almost all studies show little improvement in spelling through direct instruction.*

Additional evidence that spelling instruction is not very effective comes from Brandenburg (1919), who reported no improvement in spelling accuracy among college students after their psychology papers were “persistently and clearly” marked for spelling errors in one semester.

Finally, Cook (1912) showed that students have a very hard time learning and applying spelling rules. Cook gave a total of 96 high school and college students a spelling test containing words that exemplified spelling rules the students had studied the previous semester. He found no difference in accuracy among (1) students who said they knew the rules and used the rules while spelling the test words, (2) those who knew the rules but did not use them, and (3) those who did not know the rules at all. Also, the college students did better on the test, but the high school students knew more spelling rules, confirming the lack of a relationship between knowing spelling rules and spelling accuracy.[ 12](text00005.html#fn12)

I have found only two studies in which spelling instruction had a clear effect. In Thompson (1930), instruction accounted for approximately a half-year extra growth over and above that expected without instruction. I have pointed out, however (Krashen 1989), that Thompson’s students put in a huge amount of time in spelling instruction. In Hammill, Larsen, and McNutt (1977), students who had spelling instruction were clearly ahead of uninstructed children in grades three and four. This advantage, however, washed out by grades five and six. At this level there was no difference between instructed and uninstructed children in spelling accuracy as measured by a standardized spelling test. Spelling instruction, when it works, may only succeed in helping children learn to spell words that they would have learned to spell on their own anyway.[ 13](text00005.html#fn13)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *When spelling instruction works, it may only be helping children learn to spell words they will learn to spell on their from reading.*

Wilde (1990) estimated that each spelling word learned through direct instruction requires about 20 minutes of instructional time! Here is her logic: Spelling programs, she estimated, cover about 720 words per year and typically take up 15 minutes per day, or 45 hours per year. Children, however, have probably acquired the spellings of about 65 percent of the words before they are taught and acquire another 12 percent incidentally during the year, a total of 77 percent. Assuming the children reach 95 percent mastery of the spelling list (an optimistic assumption), this means that instruction was responsible for mastery of 18 percent of the 720 words (95 percent minus 77 percent), or 130 words. At 45 hours per year, this means each word took about 20 minutes to learn to spell.

A series of studies, dating from 1935, confirms that grammar instruction has no impact on reading and writing (see reviews by Krashen 1984 and Hill-ocks 1986). Probably the most thorough is the New Zealand study (Elley, Barham, Lamb, and Wyllie 1976). High school students were divided into three groups: One group studied traditional grammar in English class, a second studied transformational grammar, and a third studied no grammar. Students were tested every year for three years. Elley et al. found no differences in reading comprehension, writing style, writing mechanics, or vocabulary among the groups, and a follow-up done one year after the project ended also showed no differences among the groups. The authors concluded that “it is difficult to escape the conclusion that English grammar, whether traditional or transformational, has virtually no influence on the language growth of typical secondary students” (pp. 17–18). The study of complex grammatical constructions does not help reading (or writing); rather, mastery of complex grammar is a result of reading.[ 14](text00005.html#fn14)

## **Other Benefits of Reading**

### The Pleasure of Reading

Let me tell you, if you don’t know it from your own experience, that reading a good book, losing yourself in the interest of words and thoughts, is for some people (me, for instance) an incredible intensity of happiness. (Asimov 2002, p. 18)

In Krashen (1994), I proposed the pleasure hypothesis: Pedagogical activities that promote language acquisition are enjoyable. Of course, just because an activity is enjoyable does not mean it is good for language acquisition; some activities may be very enjoyable but may not help at all. Enjoyment is no guarantee of effectiveness. It is, how-ever, interesting that there is strong evidence that free voluntary reading is very enjoyable.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The pleasure hypothesis: If an activity promotes language acquisition, it is enjoyable. But enjoyment does not guarantee language acquisition.*

The evidence includes work by Csikszentmihalyi (1991), who introduced the concept of flow. Flow is the state people reach when they are deeply but effortlessly involved in an activity. In flow, the concerns of everyday life and even the sense of self disappear—our sense of time is altered and nothing but the activity itself seems to matter. Cross-cultural studies indicate that flow is easily recognized by members of widely different cultures and groups. For example, members of Japanese motorcycle gangs experience flow when riding (Sato 1992), and rock climbers experience flow when climbing (Massimini, Csikszentmihalyi, and Della Fave 1992).

Of special interest is the finding that reading “is currently perhaps the most often mentioned flow activity in the world” (Csikszentmihalyi 1991, p. 117). This finding is consistent with reports of individual pleasure readers. A resident in Walse in Northern Italy said that when he reads “I immediately immerse myself in the reading and the problems I usually worry about disappear” (Massimini et al. 1992, p. 68). One of Nell’s subjects reported, “reading removes me…from the…irritations of living…for the few hours a day I read ‘trash’ escape the cares of those around me, as well as escaping my own cares and dissatisfactions” (Nell 1988, p. 240). W.Somerset Maugham, quoted in Nell, had similar comments: “Conversation after a time bores me, games tire me, and my own thoughts, which we are told are the unfailing resource of a sensible man, have a tendency to run dry. Then I fly to my book as the opium-smoker to his pipe” (Nell 1988, p.232).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Reading is the most frequently mentioned “flow” activity.*

A number of studies confirm that students prefer in-school free reading to traditional lan-guage arts.

Bailey (1969) asked parents of 22 children in in-school free reading programs how their children reacted to in-school free reading. In response to the question, “Does your child ever complain of reading in the classroom?” all 22 responded “no.” When asked, “Does your child seem more or less interested in reading this year?” 21 said “more” and one responded that there was no difference.

Gray (1969) asked 27 children who had just completed a year of individualized reading: “If you were to choose your reading program for another year, which would you choose?” All 27 chose independent reading.

Greaney (1970) compared two groups of sixth graders in Dublin and found clear evidence that students prefer free reading to traditional language arts activities. While both groups had 40 minutes per day of reading class, the experimental group was allowed to choose their own reading material that they could read at their own rate. After the eight-month program, the experimental students rated their reading class as significantly more interesting than the comparison group rated their traditional class ([ table 1.4 ](text00005.html#tab1.4)).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Students prefer reading to traditional pedagogy.*

*Source:* Greaney (1970)

Ivey and Broaddus (2001) asked 1,765 sixth graders in 23 different schools which reading activ-ities they enjoyed most in their language arts class. The clear winners were free reading time (63 percent) and the teacher reading aloud (62 percent) (students could check more than one item).

McQuillan (1994) examined reactions of university-level foreign language and second language students to a popular literature class that included some self-selected reading. McQuillan asked students to compare self-selected reading, assigned reading, and grammar instruction: “Based on your experience this class and other second language classes, which do you believe is the most pleasurable: assigned readings, self-selected reading, or grammar?”

Because results for both second language and foreign language students were similar, McQuillan combined them. Of the 49 students, 55 percent found assigned popular reading more pleasurable, 29 percent voted for self-selected reading, and 16 percent voted for grammar.

McQuillan noted that the preference for assigned reading may have been due to the fact that the assigned readings were “well-liked material that had been popular with previous students” (1994, p. 98); those supplied by the instructor were thus good reading as well as convenient. McQuillan also asked: “Given a choice between reading popular literature and studying grammar, which would you prefer to do?” Eighty percent (n =39) said they would prefer reading popular literature. Additional very positive reactions to free reading from foreign language students are reported by Rodrigo (1997) and Dupuy (1997, 1998).

Nell (1988) provided interesting evidence showing why bedtime reading is so pleasant. Plea-sure readers were asked to read a book of their own choice, while their heart rate, muscle activity, skin potential, and respiration rate were measured; level of arousal while reading was compared to arousal during other activities, such as relaxing with eyes shut, listening to white noise, doing mental arithmetic, and doing visualization activities. Nell found that during reading, arousal was increased, as compared to relaxation with eyes shut, but a clear decline in arousal was recorded in the period just after reading, which for some measures reached a level below the baseline (eyes-shut) condition. In other words, bedtime reading is arousing, but then it relaxes you. Consistent with these findings are Nell’s results showing that bedtime reading is popular. Of 26 pleasure readers he interviewed, 13 read in bed every night and 11 “almost every night” or “most nights” (1988, p. 250).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Why bedtime reading is so pleasant.*

In a review of surveys done between 1965 and 1985, Robinson and Godbey (1997) confirm the pleasure of reading: Adult Americans consistently rated reading as enjoyable. In their 1985 survey of 2,500 adults, book and magazine reading was rated 8.3 out of 10 in enjoyment, compared to 7.5 for hobbies, 7.8 for television, and 7.2 for “conversations.”

The research literature is filled with informal reports confirming that children find reading in school to be very pleasant. Johnson (1965) reported that when her sixth graders were allowed to do recreational reading “there were no discipline problems” and children would occasionally ask for more reading time when the free reading pe-riod was over. Petre (1971) reported on the effect of 35-minute “reading breaks” in public schools in Maryland: “The most unusual happening when the reading break begins is total quietness…. One middle school principal reports a 50 percent drop in discipline cases after the school began such a reading environment” (p. 192).

Pilgreen’s high school ESL students (Pilgreen and Krashen 1993) were very positive about SSR (sustained silent reading): Of Pilgreen’s subjects, 56 percent reported that they enjoyed the SSR sessions “very much,” while 38 percent said they enjoyed them “some,” and only 7 percent reported that they only enjoyed them a little. Similarly, Sadowski (1980) asked high school students how they liked a seven-week SSR program: “Of those responding (48%), 58% gave the program strong praise and asked for its continuation, while only .09% gave the program strong negative criticism and called for its elimination” (p. 724).

Davis and Lucas (1971) studied seventh and eighth graders who did free reading for one year, and noted: “Almost without exception, the students endorsed the concept and asked for similar classes in ensuing years…the center counselors received many complaints that the fifth-minute periods were not long enough. The students wanted at least one hour daily in the center” (p. 743).

Thompson (1956) found that “most of the teachers using self-selection evaluate it by saying ‘I like it because my children like it. All my discipline problems are solved…’. One teacher asked ‘How do you stop them from reading? Mine take out a book as soon as they come in from recess, and start reading again as soon as spelling and arithmetic assignments are completed’”(p. 487).

Oliver (1976) noted that SSR had “a quieting effect” on fourth, fifth, and sixth graders and that it “exerts an inhibiting pressure on potentially disruptive behavior of individuals” (p. 227). Farrell (1982) noted that junior high school students dur-ing SSR showed “a reluctance to put (books) aside when the bell rang” (p. 51).

Before ending this cheerful section, I must point out that in two cases, in-school free reading was not perceived to be pleasant. Minton (1980) studied the impact of SSR in a high school over one semester. Both students and faculty were negative about the program (only 19 percent of the students thought it was an “excellent idea”) and were less likely to be reading after the SSR program; 28 percent said they were currently reading a book after the program ended, compared to 55 percent before the program began. Minton discusses several possible reasons SSR flopped. The most compelling to me was the fact that SSR was implemented at the same time every day, which was very awkward and disruptive. Some students were in physical education classes, some were in industrial arts, etc.

A second negative report comes from Herbert (1987). Students in grades seven, eight, and nine had mostly negative attitudes toward SSR. Herbert provides the questionnaire used but does not provide additional details about how SSR was done. She notes, however, that most of the students had positive attitudes about reading in general.

A review of several SSR studies by Yoon (2002) revealed that those who participated in SSR showed better attitudes as reflected by their responses on attitude questionnaires. In contrast to the testimonials presented in this section, however, results were modest and were only evident for studies of grade three and younger. Yoon included several unpublished doctoral dissertations in his review and relied on the results of formal questionnaires, which could explain the difference (see Von Sprecken and Krashen 2002 for commentary on the validity and limitations of attitude scales in reading).[ 15](text00005.html#fn15)

## **Reading and Cognitive Development**

There is little doubt that reading influences cognitive development, but it is surprisingly difficult to find direct evidence. Ravitch and Finn (1987), in their study *What Do Our 17-Year-Olds Know?,* found that those 17-year-olds who knew more, read more: Those who lived in a print-richer environment did better overall on tests of history and literature, and there was a clear relationship between the amount of reported leisure reading and performance on the literature test. Stanovich and Cunningham (1992) confirmed that college students who read more did better on the same test of history and literature that Ravitch and Finn used, and this relationship held even when nonverbal ability factors were controlled.

Those who read more also do better on various measures of cultural knowledge. West and Stanovich created a cultural literacy test, a checklist of 30 names of artists, entertainers, explorers, philosophers, and scientists. Those who had more print exposure did better on this test, even when other factors, such as SAT scores (West and Stanovich 1991), age, education, exposure to television (West, Stanovich, and Mitchell 1993), and nonverbal abilities (Stanovich, West, and Harrison 1995) were controlled. Stanovich and Cunningham (1993) found similar results for a test of “practical knowledge” and a test of science and social studies. Filback and Krashen (2002), in a study of Chris-tian adults, found that the amount of voluntary Bible reading done was a good predictor of biblical knowledge, but the amount of formal Bible study was not.

### Good Thinkers Read More

Studies of “good thinkers” also give us some reason to believe that reading makes you smarter. Good thinkers, however they are defined, read a great deal and have read a great deal. Simonton (1988) concluded that “omnivorous reading in childhood and adolescence correlates positively with ultimate adult success” (p. 11). Schafer and Anastasi (1968) reported that high school students considered to be creative read more than average students, with more creative students reporting that they read over 50 books per year. Emery and Csikszentmihalyi (1982) compared 15 men of blue-collar background who became college professors with 15 men of very similar background who grew up to become blue-collar workers. The future professors lived in a much more print-rich environment and did far more reading when they were young.[ 16](text00005.html#fn16)

### Reading and Writing Apprehension

Free reading has additional benefits. Lee and Krashen (1997) proposed that those who read more have less “writing apprehension” because of their superior command of the written language. They reported a modest but negative correlation between the amount of reading done and scores on a writing apprehension questionnaire for Taiwanese high school students (see also Lee 2001). The mod-est size of the correlation (r=−.21) may be because other factors affect writing apprehension, such as mastery of the composing process. It is consistent, however, with reports that those with less writing apprehension enjoy reading more (Daly and Wilson 1983).

### Conclusion

In face-to-face comparisons, reading is consistently shown to be more efficient than direct instruction. Other studies confirm that direct instruction has little or no effect. The conclusion we can draw from these findings can be easily stated: Reading is a powerful means of developing reading comprehension ability, writing style, vocabulary, grammar, and spelling. In addition, evidence shows that it is pleasant, promotes cognitive development, and lowers writing apprehension.

## **An Interpretation**

Studies showing that reading enhances literacy development lead to what should be an uncontroversial conclusion: Reading is good for you. The research, however, supports a stronger conclusion: Reading is the only way, the only way we become good readers, develop a good writing style, an adequate vocabulary, advanced grammatical competence, and the only way we become good spellers.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Reading is the only way.*

There are two reasons for suspecting that this stronger conclusion is correct. First, the major al-ternative to reading, direct instruction, is not of much help. Second, research and theory in other areas come to the same conclusion. Researchers in early reading development have concluded that we “learn to read by reading,” that we learn to read by attempting to make sense of what we see on the page (Goodman 1982; see also Flurkey and Xu 2003; Smith 1994b). In my work in language acquisition, I have concluded that we acquire language in only one way: by understanding messages, or obtaining “comprehensible input” in a low-anxiety situation (e.g., Krashen 2003a). This is precisely what free voluntary reading is: messages we understand presented in a low-anxiety environment.

If this conclusion is true, if reading is the only way, it means we have to reconsider and reanalyze what we are doing when we attempt to teach language and develop literacy directly, with drills and exercises. All we are doing when we teach language this way is testing. Traditional language arts instruction, in other words, is merely a test, a test that privileged children, who grow up with books, pass and that less fortunate children fail.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Direct instruction with drills and exercises is merely testing.*

Let me make this very concrete. Every Monday, in thousands of language and language arts classes, children are given a list of 20 vocabulary words. During the week they do “skill-building” exercises: Draw a line from the word to the definition, fill-in-the-blank, write three sentences with each word. On Friday, the children are tested on the words.

If you show the list of 20 words to a child who has read, who grew up with books, he probably knows 15 or 16 of the words already. He has seen them before, in *Choose Your Own Adventure, Harry Potter,* and *Batman Returns* . If he studies, he gets an A. If he doesn’t study, he gets a B.

If you show the list of 20 words to a child who did not grow up with books, the situation is very different. He may know five or six of the words. If he studies, with a heroic effort, he might get a D+. Direct language instruction for these children may be nothing more than a test that they fail. And like victims of child abuse, they blame themselves.[ 17](text00005.html#fn17)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Readers pass vocabulary tests; nonreaders fail.*

What do we typically do for children who did not grow up with books?: more drills and exer-cises, more of what does not work. The title of Richard Allington’s 1980 paper summarizes the results of his research: “Poor Readers Don’t Get to Read Much in Reading Groups.” Those who can read well are allowed to do more free reading. Those behind in reading have to do more worksheets, workbook pages, and exercises, a practice that can only increase the gap.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Poor readers get more of what doesn’t work.*

The Schoolboys of Barbiana, a group of eight teenagers who were unable to succeed in the Italian school system (Schoolboys of Barbiana 1970), understood that school is a test. Their thorough analysis of failure in Italian schools revealed an undeniable social class bias: At every level, children of the poor failed at higher rates than children of professional classes. The parents of those who fail, according to the Schoolboys, are persuaded to blame the children:

The poorest among the parents…don’t even suspect what is going on…. If things are not going so well, it must be that their child is not cut out for studying. “Even the teacher said so. A real gentleman. He asked me to sit down. He showed me the record book. And a test all covered with red marks. I guess we just weren’t blessed with an intelligent boy. He will go to work in the field, like us.” (p. 27)

The Schoolboys, however, placed the reason for the failure of these children elsewhere. One reason they gave is that those who are successful come to school already literate.

Teachers in intermediate schools (grades six to eight) feel they are teaching literacy, because they see improvement: “When they come into the first intermediate [grade six], they were truly illit-erate. But now, all their papers are all correct.” What has really happened is that the less literate students have failed and have left school:

Who is she talking about? Where are the boys she received in the first? The only ones left are those who could write correctly to begin with; they could probably write just as well in the third elementary. The ones who learned to write at home.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The less literate are the first to fail and drop out of school.*

The illiterate she had in the first grade are just as illiterate now. She has simply dropped them from sight. (1970, p. 49).

The problem, the Schoolboys conclude, needs to be solved at school:

At times the temptation to get rid of them [the children of the poor) is strong. But if we lose them, school is no longer school. It is a hospital that tends to the healthy and rejects the sick. It becomes just a place to strengthen the existing differences to a point of no return. (1970, pp. 12–13)

[1. ](text00005.html#ft1)The following studies were used to complete [table 1.1 ](text00005.html#tab1.1):

Duration less than seven months:

Duration seven months to one year:

*Positive:* Fader 1976; Elley 1991 (Singapore, P1 survey); Jenkins 1957; Manning and Manning 1984 (peer-interaction group); Bader, Veatch, and Eldridge 1987; Davis 1988 (medium ability readers); Mason and Krashen 1997 (four-year college student study, Extensive Reading); Mason and Krashen 1997 (two-year college student study, Extensive Reading); Lituanas, Jacobs, and Renandya 1999 (Extensive Reading).

*No Difference:* Manning and Manning 1984 (pure SSR); Manning and Manning 1984 (student-teacher conference group); Schon, Hopkins, and Vojir 1984 (Chandler); Schon, Hopkins, and Vojir 1985 (grades seven and eight); McDonald, Harris, and Mann 1966; Davis and Lucas 1971 (grades seven and eight); Healy 1963; Davis 1998 (high-ability readers)

Duration longer than one year:

*Positive:* Elley and Mangubhai 1983 (grades four and five); Elley 1991 (Singapore, sample of 512); Elley 1991 (Singapore, P3 survey); Aranow 1961; Bohnhorst and Sellars 1959; Cyrog 1962; Johnson 1965.

*No Difference:* Cline and Kretke 1980; Elley et al. 1976.

In Davis (1988), superior gains were made by the medium-ability group (a full extra year of prog-ress!) but the difference between the readers and comparisons was not statistically significant for the high-ability readers. Nevertheless, the high-ability readers gained an additional 5 percentile points (five months) over the comparisons. Also, the failure of the high-ability group to show significant gains can be explained: SSR works best with less mature readers: It is doubtful that readers of this note, already excellent readers, will improve with a few minutes per day of SSR. Cline and Kretke (1980) reported no difference in gains in reading in a long-term study, but subjects were junior high school students who were reading two years above grade level and had probably already established a reading habit.

In Manning and Manning (1984), students who engaged in sustained silent reading made better gains than a comparison group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Sustained silent reading was significantly better than traditional instruction, however, when readers interacted with each other, that is, when they discussed their reading with each other and shared books.

The National Reading Panel (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 2000) claimed that the advantage shown by readers in Burley (1980) was “small.” Students in SSR were compared to students in three other conditions. For one measure, the overall F was 2.72 (p< .05), for the other F=8.74, (p<.01). Burley does not report the details of the follow-up comparisons, only that the readers were significantly better. It was not possible to calculate effect sizes from the data presented. It is not clear how the National Reading Panel concluded that this difference was small, especially considering the fact that the treatment lasted only six weeks and contained only 14 hours of reading. In a response to my comment, Shanahan (2000) claims that “the problem here was not with the statistics, but with the design of the study. Each of the four treatments was offered by a different teacher, and students were not ran-domly assigned to the groups. It is impossible to unambiguously attribute the treatment differences to the methods.” This is not accurate: Student assignment was in fact random (Burley 1980, p. 158), and the four teachers were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. In addition, the group that did SSR was superior to three different comparison groups, taught by three different teachers.

The National Reading Panel interpreted Holt and O’Tuel (1989) as showing no difference between readers and comparisons in reading comprehension. This study consisted of two samples, seventh and eighth graders. According to the text of the article, for the total sample, the readers were significantly better on tests of reading comprehension. The text also states that the difference was significant for the seventh graders but not the eighth graders. In Holt and O’Tuel’s Table 2, however, the reading comprehension result for grade seven is clearly not significant. The effect size for grade seven (my calculations), based on posttest means, was a substantial .58, but for grade eight it was only .07. The NRP did not mention this discrepancy. I classified the results of this study as a split-decision.

[2. ](text00005.html#ft2)Tsang (1996) reported that Hong Kong middle and high school students who participated in an after-school extensive reading program lasting 24 weeks made better gains in writing than comparison students in a math program, and also did better than students who did extra writing. Readers showed better gains in content and language use, but not in vocabulary, organization, or mechanics. Tsang notes that the failure to gain in vo-cabulary may be due to what was read (graded, pedagogical readers), or to the insensitivity of the writing task to detect gains in vocabulary; the topic may have demanded little new vocabulary. Tudor and Hafiz (1989) and Hafiz and Tudor (1990) also reported no improvement for the variety of vocabulary used in writing after a sustained silent reading experience; the nature of the task and/or restrictions in what was read could explain these results as well. In addition, all of these studies were relatively short term, lasting less than one academic year.

Renandya, Rajan, and Jacobs (1999) examined the progress of 49 Vietnamese government officials who took a two-month intensive English course in Singapore. Their proficiency in English was considered “low to high intermediate” before taking the course.

Part of the course consisted of extensive reading: Students were required to read either 20 books in English or at least 800 pages. Importantly, students were encouraged to read books that they could read without too much difficulty and that were interesting, and were encouraged to read different kinds of books. After reading the books, students wrote short summaries. Teachers gave feedback on the content of the summaries, with little emphasis on writing mechanics. Questionnaire results confirmed that the students found the reading to be interesting, comprehensible, and enjoyable.

Renandya et al. reported that those students who did the most reading in the class made the best gains (r=.386) on a general test of English (listening, reading, grammar, and vocabulary). This predictor survived a multiple regression analysis, which means that it was a significant predictor even when other factors were considered, such as the amount of reading done in English before arriving in Singapore.

Although no control group was used in this study, the results are very suggestive. It is hard to image any other source for the gains than reading —one could argue, for example, that those who read more were the more motivated students in general and were also those who studied their grammar and vocabulary harder. I have argued, however, that direct grammar study is not particularly effective (e.g., Krashen 2003a). Finally, it could be argued that writing summaries was responsible for the gains. Research reviewed in [chapter 3 ](text00007.html#ha56), as well as Tsang’s results, above, indicate however that adding writing does not add to the power of reading.

[3. ](text00005.html#ft3)Elley (1991) also contains some fascinating discussion of reactions to in-school free reading. Some adults were concerned about how well those in the reading sections would do on tests. Elley’s data confirm that the readers do very well on tests, better in fact than those who study grammar. My view is that they do well on tests because they can’t help it: Thanks to reading, they have subconsciously absorbed or “acquired” many of the conventions of writing, and using them is automatic and involuntary. In fact, I think it is fair to say that well-read people nearly always write acceptably well and find it very difficult to write poorly. Another concern raised by some of the adults was that the children in the reading sections were “merely enjoying themselves.” The attitude that acquisition of language must be painful is unfortunately widespread.

[4. ](text00005.html#ft4)The National Reading Panel (NRP), supported by the U.S. government, also reviewed studies of in-school reading, and reached the startling conclusion that there is no clear evidence sup-porting this practice (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 2000). They were, however, able to find only 14 comparisons, all lasting less than one academic year, between students in in-school free reading programs and comparison children, devoting only six pages of their massive report to this topic (as compared to approximately 120 pages devoted to research on phonemic awareness and phonics).

Interestingly, in-school reading did not fare badly even in the limited analysis done by the NRP, with in-school readers doing better in four cases, and never doing worse. As discussed above, even a finding of “no difference” suggests that free reading is just as good as traditional instruction and is therefore preferable, because it is more pleasant and provides benefits other than literacy development.

I have also argued (Krashen 2001) that the NRP not only missed many studies, they also misinterpreted some of the ones they included.

[5. ](text00005.html#ft5)It has been argued that the number of words acquired in these studies is not sufficient to account for growth in vocabulary or adult vocabulary size (Horst, Cobb, and Meara 1998; Waring and Takakei 2003): It has been estimated that about one million words of reading for a fifth-grade child will result in vocabulary growth of several thousand words per year, enough to account for adult vocabulary size. One million words is an average dose of reading for middle-class children (Anderson, Wilson, and Fielding 1988) and is not difficult to attain, if interesting reading material is available. Comic books, for example, contain at least 2,000 words, while teen romances, such as the Sweet Valley High series, contain 40,000 to 50,000 words (Parrish and Atwood 1985).

Horst, Cobb, and Meara (1998) reported a gain of only five words after subjects read a 20,000-word book. Extrapolated to one million words read, this means growth of only 250 words in a year. The procedure used in this study, however, was odd: Students followed along in the text while the story was read aloud in class by the teacher in six class sessions. This was done to ensure that students covered the entire text and to prevent looking up words while reading. Horst et al. assure us that students were “absorbed by the story” (p. 211), but this method means readers can not proceed at their own pace and cannot reread and pause. In addition, subjects may have acquired words from the text not included in the test, which was especially likely in this study because a long text was used (but unlikely in Waring and Takakai, discussed below, as a controlled vocabulary graded reader was used). Finally, the measures used by Horst et al. did not grant partial credit.

Waring and Takakei (2003) reported that forgetting occurred rapidly in their read and test study: Their subjects, intermediate adult students of English as a foreign language in Japan, read a graded reader of approximately 6,000 words that contained 25 words that had been changed into substitute words (e.g., “yes” became “yoot,” “beautiful” became “smorty”). The substitute words appeared from one to 18 times. The reading took about one hour. On tests given immediately after the reading, subjects got about 10 right on a multiple-choice test and five right on a translation test. But three months later, scores dropped to six correct and one correct on these tests, far too little to account for vocabulary growth. The gain reported by Waring and Takakei, one word after reading a 6,000-word book, projects to less than 200 words gained from one million words read.

The results of this study suggest that vocabu-lary acquisition is distributed and incremental; that is, it is best done when encounters with words are spaced or spread out over time, and it happens a little at a time.

For some kinds of memorization, it has been shown that distributed practice (spaced out over time) is far more efficient than massed (all at once) practice. Bustead (1943), a replication of Ebbinghouse’s original results, is relevant here. Subjects simply read a passage (they did not attempt to memorize it) several times with different time intervals between readings. If a student read a 200-line poem many times, with readings one hour apart, Bumstead reported that it would take 24 readings to memorize the poem, a total of 229 minutes of reading. If the readings were 48 hours apart, it would take only 10 readings, or 95 minutes. If the readings were 192 hours apart, it would take only eight readings, or 77 minutes. Distributed exposure can thus triple efficiency, and, of great interest to us, it is especially powerful on delayed tests (see Willingham 2002 for a review of research). Encountering words in natural texts typically provides, of course, distributed exposure to vocabulary. Waring and Takakei’s treatment lasted only one hour, an example of massed exposure: Subjects did not encounter any of the target words during the interval between the treatment and the delayed tests, because the words were artificial and do not occur in normal English. This explains the rapid forgetting. (It is likely that many of the nadsat words readers of *A Clockwork Orange* recalled would have faded in three months as well; forgetting, however, would probably not be as dramatic as in Waring and Takakei, as the book was read over a longer time, a few days, as contrasted with one hour.)

Swanborn and de Glopper (1999) found that studies using tests that give partial credit when sub-jects get some of the meaning of the word right show higher rates of vocabulary learning. This suggests that many words are not learned all at once when they are seen in context. Rather, word knowledge grows in “small increments.” At any given time, there are words we know well, words we do not know, and words in between Twadell (1973) suggested that “we may ‘know’ a very large number of words with various degrees of vagueness—words which are in a twilight zone between the darkness of entire unfamiliarity and the brightness of complete familiarity” (p. 73). (See Wesche and Paribakht 1996 for another way of measuring partial familiarity with vocabulary.)

Waring and Takakai allowed partial credit on their translation test, but they report that partial credit was rarely granted. This could have been due to a reluctance of subjects to guess. Also, partial credit was given when the subject gave a word with “a similar meaning,” not for a word that contained some of the semantic features of the correct answer. Waring and Takakai did not include a mechanism for partial credit on their multiple-choice test; distractors did not overlap in meaning with the correct option. As noted earlier, other researchers allowed partial credit on multiple-choice tests when the subject chose a distractor that partially overlapped in meaning with the correct answer. Measures more sensitive to partial credit would have resulted in increased scores that might have matched estimates of vocabulary growth.

Laufer (2003) claims that for adult second language students, writing activities in which stu-dents use new words in sentences and essays are more effective for vocabulary acquisition than reading words in stories. In the reading condition in her study, however, subjects were provided with or looked up the meanings of unfamiliar words; her study was thus a comparison of different ways of consciously learning words. Adding to the unnaturalness, readers were either provided with marginal glosses of the unfamiliar words or looked up the unfamiliar words in the dictionary. Laufer also presents an unusual argument against relying on reading for vocabulary growth in a second language, maintaining that the amount of reading necessary for substantial vocabulary growth cannot be provided in a classroom context because so little time is available (2003, p. 273). But this is actually an argument *for* reading, because recreational reading is one of the few activities a foreign language acquirer can engage in without a classroom and without a teacher. In fact, it doesn’t even require speakers of the language, and the language student can continue reading long after the class ends. There is little hope that students will continue to engage in sentence production exercises after they finish studying the language formally.

[6. ](text00005.html#ft6)Most of the contexts in Schatz and Baldwin (1986) were not helpful or “facilitative”; readers could not successfully acquire unfamiliar words from them. Passages used, however, were only three sentences long. Determining the meaning of some words may take more than three sentences. Consider this example from Schatz and Baldwin: “He takes out an envelope from a drawer, and takes paper money from it. He looks at it ruefully, and then with decision puts it into his pocket, with decision takes down his hat. Then dressed, with indecision looks out the window to the house of Mrs. Lithebe, and shakes his head” (p. 443).

From just this passage, it is very hard to arrive at the meaning of “ruefully.” With wider con-text (several pages, or even chapters) and a deeper understanding of the character and what has happened in the story, the reader would have a much better chance. (See, for example, the discussion of the *Clockwork Orange* study in the text.)

Some experimenters have been able to improve vocabulary acquisition by rewriting texts to make contexts more “facilitative” or “considerate.” Although readers in these studies are able to acquire more vocabulary from altered texts, readers still acquire an impressive amount from original, unaltered texts (Herman et al. 1987; Konopak 1988).

[7. ](text00005.html#ft7)See Ormrod (1986) for results similar to Nisbet’s, and a similar interpretation. Gilbert’s studies (Gilbert 1934a, 1934b, 1935) were, to my knowledge, the first read and test studies showing that spelling knowledge can be increased by reading.

[8. ](text00005.html#ft8)What about assigned reading? It is reasonable to expect that assigned reading will have a positive impact on literacy development if it is interesting and comprehensible. The research is consistent with this interpretation. Rehder (1980) reported spectacular gains for high school students in reading comprehension and vocabulary after a one-semester course in popular literature, which included required reading and a limited amount of self-selection (students were allowed to choose some of the reading from a list).

Lao and Krashen (2000) reported similar results for students of English as a foreign language. They compared progress in reading over one semester between university-level EFL students in Hong Kong who participated in a popular litera-ture class that emphasized reading for content and enjoyment and students in a traditional academic skills class. Those in the popular literature class read six novels, five assigned and one self-selected. The popular literature group made far better gains in vocabulary and reading rate. These researchers apparently succeeded in assigning reading that was genuinely interesting for their students. (See also McQuillan 1994, discussed in the text.)

But not all assigned reading is compelling: O’Brian (1931) reported that a traditional skill-building program was superior to an extensive reading program for fifth and sixth graders. The reading, however, was assigned reading on social science topics. Sixth graders interviewed by Worthy (1998) “read the books they were assigned in school, and both had enjoyed some of them but ‘hated’ most” (p. 513). Two years later, as eighth graders, one boy described the assigned reading in language arts class as “boring and stupid” (p. 514). Both boys were enthusiastic readers on their own, however. Bintz (1993) described several students who were considered to be “passive and reluctant” readers by teachers but who read avidly on their own. These secret readers said they “expected assigned reading to be boring” (p. 611). One 11th grader told Bintz, “I don’t remember much from books I have to read in school. I do remember almost everything from books I choose to read” (p. 610).

There is, of course, good reason to assign certain books (see “Conclusions” in [chapter 3 ](text00007.html#ha56)of this book), but including self-selected reading is important because it ensures that reading is understandable and is for genuine interest.

[9. ](text00005.html#ft9)Finegan provides this example: The words “vagrant” and “homeless” are synonyms. “Vagrant,” however, carries a negative affective mean-ing, while “homeless” is neutral or even positive (p. 187).

[10. ](text00005.html#ft10)For a statistical analysis of Cornman’s data using modern statistical procedures, see Krashen and White (1991). We confirmed that Cornman’s conclusions were basically correct: Uninstructed students did just as well as instructed students on spelling words in their own compositions. We found some effect for formal instruction in spelling on some of the tests that focused students on form (words presented in a list, out of context), that encouraged the use of conscious knowledge. This finding is consistent with current language acquisition theory (Krashen 2003a).

[11. ](text00005.html#ft11)See Krashen and White (1991) for a reanalysis of these data, which confirmed Rice’s claims. As in our reanalysis of Cornman (1902; see note 10, this chapter), spelling instruction had some effect on tests in which students were focused on form.

[12. ](text00005.html#ft12)Cook also reported that even though the students had just studied the rules, many could not recall them. Of those who did recall the rules, the version they gave was often much simpler than the version they were recently taught: “Curiously enough, most of the collegians who cited a version of the ie/ei rule as consciously used relied upon the word ‘Alice’ and other mnemonic devices which gave a clue to only one or two of the 11 words (relating to the ei/ei rule)…. No [high school] freshman cited the rule as recently taught, but four had it almost correct…. Three [high school] seniors gave the rule substantially as taught, but nearly all the others who cited anything gave a version of something taught in earlier years, the ‘Alice’ rule, etc. The rule seems more likely to stick as first learned” (1912, p. 322). (The “Alice” rule is new to me; apparently it reminds writers that “i” comes before “e” except after “c.”)

[15. ](text00005.html#ft15)Von Sprecken and Krashen (2002) reviewed studies using reading attitude surveys and concluded that contrary to popular opinion there is no decline in interest in reading as children get older. Older children and adolescents have more time pressure than younger children do, and have other interests, but interest in reading remains strong (see also Bintz 1993).

[16. ](text00005.html#ft16)It appears to be the case that good thinkers, as a group, read more than the general population does. After a certain point, however, the relationship between the amount of reading done and thinking is less clear. Goertzel, Goertzel, and Goertzel (1978) studied 300 “eminent personalities of our age” (subjects of biographies published after 1963 in the Menlo Park Library) and reported that almost half of the group were “omnivorous readers” (p. 11). Simonton (1984) did a reanalysis of these data, however, and found only a .12 correlation between “achieved eminence” and amount of reading done. Van Zelst and Kerr (1951) reported a modest .26 correlation between number of professional journals read regularly and productivity (published papers and inventions) in a sample of scientists (controlled for age). They also reported that the relationship between reading and productivity resulted in a bimodal curve—some less pro-ductive scientists read a great deal. Apparently, good thinkers do read a lot, but it is possible to over-read. Wallas (1926) was aware of this, noting that “industrious passive reading” (p. 48) may interfere with problem solving.

What appears to be the case is that wide reading is clearly helpful, but when one is reading to solve specific problems, selective reading is more efficient, that is, reading what you need to read to solve the problem you are currently working on. Brazerman (1985) provides support for this idea. Brazerman examined the reading habits of top physicists and reported that they read a great deal, visiting the library frequently to keep up with current research. They distinguished, however, between “core” and “peripheral” reading, reading carefully only what was relevant to their interests at the time.

[17. ](text00005.html#ft17)Research confirms that the difference among children in vocabulary size is enormous. Smith (1941) found, in fact, that some first graders had larger vocabularies than some high school students. According to Smith, the range of basic words known to first graders was from 5,500 to 32,000, and for twelfth graders from 28,200 to 73,200. Other researchers have come up with more conservative data, but still conclude that there are huge differences among children. White, Graves, and Slater (1990) concluded that “mainstream” children know about 50 percent more words than “disadvantaged” children know (see also Graves, Brunett, and Slater 1982.
