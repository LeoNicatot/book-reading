# Introduction

*The sophisticated skills demanded by high-level academic or professional work—the ability to understand multiple plots or complex issues, a sensitivity to tone, the expertise to know immediately what is crucial to a text and what can be skimmed—can be acquired only through years of **avid** reading.* —Mary Leonhardt (1998)

## Is There a Literacy Crisis?

I first heard about **the literacy crisis** in 1987 on the *Oprah Winfrey Show*. Oprah Winfrey had four adult “**illiterates**” as guests, people who, it was asserted, were completely unable to read and write. Their stories were touching, and by now, familiar to the reading public. They told how they had been “passed along” in school, surviving by paying careful attention in class and relying on friends. They had evolved strategies for getting through the day; for example, when they went to a restaurant with friends, they would wait to see what other people were ordering, then order the same thing.

Soon after this program, the **plight** of illiterates was dramatized in a made-for-TV movie starring Dennis Weaver. And soon after that, *Stanley and Iris* was released, a film telling the story of an adult illiterate. Thanks to television shows such as *Oprah Winfrey,* these films, and numerous articles in the press and in popular magazines, the public has the impression that a sizable percentage of the public is completely illiterate, that the public schools are graduating **hordes** of young people who can’t read. The public also has the impression that illiteracy is curable by tutoring sessions that teach nonreaders to read aloud—in other words, phonics.

Both impressions are wrong. There is no literacy crisis, at least not the kind of crisis the media have portrayed. There are, first of all, very few people who have been through the educational system who are completely unable to read and write. In fact, literacy, defined simply as the ability to read and write on a basic level, has been steadily rising in the United States for the last hundred years (see, e.g., Stedman and Kaestle 1987).

There is, however, a problem. Nearly everyone in the United States can read and write. They just don’t read and write well enough. Although basic literacy has been on the increase for the last century, the demands for literacy have been rising faster. Many people clearly don’t read and write well enough to handle the complex literacy demands of modern society. The problem is thus not how to bring students to the second- or third-grade reading level; the problem is how to bring them beyond this.

(It is not clear, by the way, that heavy doses of phonics is the answer even at the beginning level; for extensive discussion of the most recent controversies, see Krashen 2002; Garan 2002; Coles 2003).

The cure for this kind of literacy crisis lies, in my opinion, in doing one activity, an activity that is all too often rare in the lives of many people: reading. Specifically, I am recommending a certain kind of reading—free voluntary reading (henceforth FVR). FVR means reading because you want to. For school-age children, FVR means no book report, no questions at the end of the chapter, and no looking up every vocabulary word. FVR means putting down a book you don’t like and choosing another one instead. It is the kind of reading highly literate people do all the time.

I will not claim that FVR is the complete answer. Free readers are not guaranteed admission to Harvard Law School. What the research tells me is that when children or less literate adults start reading for pleasure, however, good things will happen. Their reading comprehension will improve, and they will find difficult, academic-style texts easier to read. Their writing style will improve, and they will be better able to write prose in a style that is acceptable to schools, business, and the scientific community. Their vocabulary will improve, and their spelling and control of grammar will improve.

In other words, those who do free voluntary reading have a chance. The research also tells me, however, that those who do not develop the pleasure reading habit simply don’t have a chance—they will have a very difficult time reading and writing at a level high enough to deal with the demands of today’s world.

FVR is also, I am convinced, the way to achieve advanced second language proficiency. It is one of the best things a second language acquirer can do to bridge the gap from the beginning level to truly advanced levels of sec-ond language proficiency.

This book examines the research on FVR, the ways FVR can be imple-mented, and issues related to reading, writing, and literacy. The possibilities free voluntary reading offers individuals and society are great. The goal of this book is to show the reader what free voluntary reading has to offer.
