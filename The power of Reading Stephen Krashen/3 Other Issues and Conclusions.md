# 3. Other Issues and Conclusions

## **The Limits of Reading**

Even with massive free voluntary reading of appropriate texts, complete acquisition of the conventions of writing may not take place; even very well-read people may have gaps in their competence. Typically, these gaps are small, and many readers will recognize them as problems they experience. Here are some examples:

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Even with extensive FVR gaps in literacy may remain.*

*Spelling demons:* Words like “committment” (or is it “commitment”?) and “independence” (or is it “independance”?).

*Punctuation:* Does the comma go inside or outside the quotation mark?

*Grammar:* Subject-verb agreement is sentences such as: A large group of boys is (are?) expected to arrive tomorrow.

These errors usually do not make much of a difference in terms of communication. “Independance,” for example, communicates the idea just as well as “independence.” Obeying the rules, however, is important for cosmetic reasons; readers often find written language containing errors irritating, and this reaction can detract from a writer’s message.

Why do well-read readers have gaps? What prevents the full acquisition of the written lan-guage? One explanation is that not all the print is attended to; that is, successful reading for meaning does not require the full use of everything that appears on the page. It has been demonstrated (Goodman, in Flurkey and Xu 2003; Smith 1994b) that fluent readers generate hypotheses about the text they are about to read, based on what they have read already, their knowledge of the world, and their knowledge of language, and only attend to those aspects of print they need to confirm their hypotheses. For example, most readers can guess what the last word of this sentence is going to—. Good readers don’t need to fully and carefully perceive the “be” at the end of the sentence in order to understand it; they just need to see enough to confirm that it is there.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Good readers do not attend to everything on the page.*

Thus, competent readers do not pay attention to every detail on the page, and they may fail to acquire the its/it’s distinction or whether certain words end in -ence or -ance. These tiny gaps, in my view, are a small price to pay for fluent and efficient reading.[ 1](text00007.html#fn1)

Even those aspects of print that are attended to and understood may not be acquired. Several researchers have hypothesized that affective factors may be responsible for failure to acquire some aspects of language. Dulay and Burt (1977; see also Dulay, Burt, and Krashen 1982) have suggested that for language acquisition to occur, language acquirers need to be “open” to the input, or have a low “Affective Filter.” When language acquirers are anxious, or put on the defensive, the input may be understood, but it will not reach those parts of the brain that are responsible for language acquisition (what Chomsky has called the “language ac-quisition device”; see Chomsky 1965). A block, the Affective Filter, will keep the input out.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The “affective filter” prevents input from reaching the “language acquisition device.”*

Smith (1988) has pointed out that a great deal of learning occurs effortlessly, when learners consider themselves to be potential members of certain groups, or “clubs,” and expect to learn. Teenagers, for example, learn the elaborate dress code, slang, and behavior patterns of their peers not by deliberate study but by observing others and deciding they want to be like them. Similarly, Smith argues, when readers conclude that they are potential members of the “literacy club,” people who read and write, they “read like writers” and absorb the enormous amount of knowledge that writers possess. Smith’s idea is quite consistent with the Affective Filter hypothesis: Considering oneself a member or potential member of the literacy club results in a lower Affective Filter, with more of the input reaching the language acquisition device.[ 2](text00007.html#fn2)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *When readers consider themselves to be potential members of “the literacy club,” they acquire the enormous amount of information that writers possess.*

What can be done to fill these tiny gaps, those that remain even after massive reading and after entrance into the literacy club? We do, unfortunately, need to be concerned, because society’s standards for writing accuracy are 100 percent. Errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are not tolerated in writing intended to be read by others, unless it is informal e-mail.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Direct teaching can help fill some of the gap.*

Direct teaching and the use of grammar handbooks and dictionaries can help us fill at least part of the gap. Such conscious learning of language is very limited, however, and needs to be used with caution—an excessive concern with form or correctness while trying to work out new ideas in writing can be very disruptive. Experienced writers know this and limit their “editing” to the final draft, after their ideas have been worked out on the page (see, e.g., Sommers 1980). It also seems rea-sonable to expect that only more mature students will be able to develop extensive conscious knowledge; it might be most efficient to delay this kind of direct teaching until high school.

Given extensive free reading, however, and a genuine invitation to join the literacy club, readers will acquire nearly all of the conventions of writing. With enough reading, good grammar, good spelling, and good style will be part of them, absorbed or acquired effortlessly.

## **Writing**

Writing deserves more space than I am giving it here. My goal, however, is not to provide a complete survey of what is known about writing and how writing ability develops, but to make two crucial points:

\1. Writing style does not come from actual writing experience, but from reading.

\2. Actual writing can help us solve problems and make us smarter.

### Writing Style Comes from Reading

The research reviewed earlier strongly suggests that we learn to write by reading. To be more precise, we acquire writing style, the special language of writing, by reading. We have already seen plenty of evidence that this is so: In [chapter 1 ](text00005.html#ha1)we saw that those who participate in free reading programs write better (e.g., Elley and Mangubhai 1983; McNeil in Fader 1976), and those who report they read more write better (e.g., Applebee 1978; Alexander 1986; Salyer 1987; Janopoulous 1986; Kaplan and Palhinda 1981; Applebee, Langer, Mullis, Jenkins, and Foertsch 1990). As noted in [chapter 1 ](text00005.html#ha1), Lee and Krashen (1996) and Lee (2001) have confirmed that more reading is related to better writing in Chinese (Mandarin).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Formal language is too complex to be learned one rule at a time.*

There are other reasons to suspect that writing style comes from reading. The “complexity argument” (see [chapter 1 ](text00005.html#ha1)) applies to writing as well. All the ways in which “formal” written language differs from informal conversational language are too complex to be learned one rule at a time. Even though readers can recognize good writing, researchers have not succeeding in completely describing just what it is that makes a “good” writing style good. It is, therefore, sensible to suppose that writing style is not consciously learned but is largely absorbed, or subconsciously acquired, from reading.

According to common wisdom, we learn to write by actually writing. The reading hypothesis asserts that this is not true, at least as far as style is concerned. Smith (1988) tells us why we do not learn to write by writing:

I thought the answer [to how we learn to write] must be that we learn to write by writing until I reflected on how little anyone writes in school, even the eager students, and how little feedback is provided…. No one writes enough to learn more than a small part of what writers need to know. (p. 19)

The research confirms Smith’s reflections.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *We do not learn to write by writing.*

Actual writing in school appears to be infre-quent. Here is one typical report: Applebee, Langer, and Mullis (1986) asked students how many essays and reports they had written over six weeks for any school subject. Only 18.6 percent of the fourth graders wrote more than 10, while only 7.8 percent of the eleventh graders wrote more than 10.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The actual amount of writing done by a typical student is low.*

Writing outside of school is also not frequent: Applebee et al.’s llth graders did the most out-of-school writing, but only 17.4 percent kept diaries, 37.3 percent said that they wrote letters to friends, and 74.8 percent said they wrote notes and messages at least weekly. (See also Applebee et al. 1990 and Snow, Barnes, Chandler, Goodman, and Hemphill 1991 for similar results.)

Research by Rice (1986) allows us to make at least a crude comparison of writing and reading frequency outside of school. Rice probed reading and writing behavior of several groups, and I present one of them (high verbal adults) as a representative sample. These subjects reported 15.1 hours per week in “total reading,” but only two hours per week in writing (1.9 hours for “short writing” and .1 hour for “long writing”). Assuming even a very slow reading rate (200 words per minute) and a very fast writing rate (typing at 60 words per minute), this still means that people deal with far more words in reading than in writing, a ratio of 25 to 1. More likely, the true ratio is closer to 150 to 1. Considering the complexity of the system that is to be acquired, these data severely weaken the case for writing as an important source of language acquisition. (See also Evans and Gleadow 1983 for similar estimates of reading and writing frequency. Thanks to e-mail, people may be writing more these days. This possibility has not been investigated to my knowledge.)

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *People encounter far more language in reading than in writing.*

### More Writing Does Not Mean Better Writing

Several additional reports have confirmed that students do little writing in school and outside of school: The recently published National Council on Writing report (2003) noted that according to the NAEP data, students in elementary school spend on the average only three hours per week or less on writing assignments. They recommend that schools double the amount of time students spend writing, and insist that “writing be taught in all subjects and at all grade levels” (p. 3). The research, however, does not support this simple solution: More writing does not necessarily lead to better writing.

Although some studies show that good writers do more writing than poor writers (see Applebee et al. 1990 and studies summarized in Krashen 1984), increasing the amount of writing students do does not increase their writing proficiency. First language studies in English include Dressel, Schmid, and Kincaid (1952); Arnold (1964); and Varble (1990). First language studies showing no relationship between writing frequency and quality in Chinese are Lee and Krashen (1997) and Lee (2001). Hunting (1967) describes unpublished dissertation research showing that writing quantity is not related to writing quality. An exception is Lokke and Wykoff (1948); very small differences were found, however, between college freshmen who wrote two themes per week and those who wrote one theme a week. In addition, Hillocks (1986), after an extensive review that included unpublished dissertation research, found that writing classes that emphasized free writing did not produce significantly better writing than comparison classes.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Numerous studies show that increasing writing quantity does not affect writing quality.*

Second language studies include Burger (1989) and Mason (2003). Burger’s subjects were students of English as a second language in Ottawa, Canada, enrolled in sheltered subject matter courses (teaching language through content). She reported that adding an extra class on writing, which included correction of students’ written errors, had no impact on writing quality or on tests of general English proficiency.

Mason (2003), in a study of adult (college student) EFL in Japan, compared the effect of three different activities as a supplement to free voluntary reading: writing short commentaries of what was read in the first language (Japanese), writing commentaries in the second language (English), and writing commentaries in the second language and getting errors corrected. She found no difference among the three groups in gains in writing accuracy (or reading achievement) after three semesters. In addition, the extra time devoted to writing clearly made no contribution to language development: The two groups who wrote in English devoted an extra two hours per week to writing in English, with no dividends in increased proficiency.

Hypothesizing that writing style comes from reading, not writing, is consistent with what is known about language acquisition: Language acquisition comes from input, not output, from comprehension, not production. Thus, if you write a page a day, your writing style or your command of mechanics will not improve. However, other good things may result from your writing, as we shall see in the next section.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Language acquisition comes from input, not output; from comprehension, not production.*

No studies, to my knowledge, have attempted to find a relationship between what is read and writing style. Such a relationship surely exists, because different styles have different linguistic char-acteristics. Smith (1988) has noted this, and advises: “To learn to write for newspapers, you must read newspapers; textbooks about them will not suffice. For magazines, browse through magazines rather than through correspondence courses on magazine writing. To write poetry, read it” (p. 20).

Nevertheless, it is probably true that reading anything at all will help all writing, at least to some extent. Although there are clearly different styles of prose, there is also considerable overlap among styles (Biber 1986): So-called narrative style has, for example, some but not all of the characteristics of formal, expository prose. Thus, reading novels will not make you a competent essayist; you will have to read lots of essays to develop the essay-type style. But reading novels will provide at least some of the features of essay style; a novel reader will write a much better essay, stylistically, than someone who has read little of anything. And, as emphasized throughout this book, doing light reading will provide the competence that makes heavier reading more comprehensible.

### What Writing Does

Although writing does not help us develop writing style, writing has other virtues. As Smith (1988) has pointed out, we write for at least two reasons. First, and most obvious, we write to communicate with others. But perhaps more important, we write for ourselves, to clarify and stimulate our thinking. Most of our writing, even if we are published authors, is for ourselves.

As Elbow (1973) has noted, it is difficult to hold more than one thought in mind at a time. When we write our ideas down, the vague and abstract become clear and concrete. When thoughts are on paper, we can see the relationships among them, and can come up with better thoughts. Writing, in other words, can make you smarter.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Writing can help us think through and solve problems.*

Readers who keep a diary or journal know all about this—you have a problem, you write it down, and at least some of the problem disap-pears. Sometimes the entire problem goes away. Here is an example of this happening, a letter written to Ann Landers in 1976:

Dear Ann: I’m a 26-year-old woman and feel like a fool asking you this question, but—should I marry the guy or not? Jerry is 30, but sometimes he acts like 14…

Jerry is a salesman and makes good money but has lost his wallet three times since I’ve known him and I’ve had to help him meet the payments on his car.

The thing that bothers me most, I think, is that I have the feeling he doesn’t trust me. After every date he telephones. He says it’s to “say an extra goodnight,” but I’m sure he is checking to see if I had a late date with someone else.

One night I was in the shower and didn’t hear the phone. He came over and sat on the porch all night. I found him asleep on the swing when I went to get the paper the next morning at 6:30 A.M. I had a hard time convincing him I had been in the house the whole time.

Now on the plus side: Jerry is very good-looking and appeals to me physically. Well—that does it. I have been sitting here with this pen in my hand for 15 minutes trying to think of something else good to say about him and nothing comes to mind.

Don’t bother to answer this. You have helped me more than you will ever know.—Eyes Opened. (Permission granted by Ann Landers and Creators Syndicate.)

Perhaps the clearest experimental evidence showing that writing helps thinking is from a series of studies by Langer and Applebee (1987). High school students were asked to read social studies passages and then study the information in them either by writing an analytic essay on an as-signed question relating to the passage, or by using other study techniques (e.g., note taking, answering comprehension questions, writing summaries, “normal” studying without writing). Students were then given a variety of tests on the material in the passages. Langer and Applebee reported that “in general, any kind of written response leads to better performance than does reading without writing” (p. 130). In their third study, they showed that essay writing did not result in greater retention when the reading passage was easy; when the passage they read was difficult, however, essay writers did much better than students using other study techniques. Similar results have been reported by Newell (1984), Marshall (1987), and Newell and Winograd (1989).

Sometimes just a little bit of writing can make a big difference. In Ganguli’s study (1989) college mathematics students who devoted three minutes per period to describing in writing an important concept covered in class easily outperformed a comparison group on the semester final exam. For a review of additional research supporting the hypothesis that writing “can make you smarter,” see Applebee (1984), Boice (1994), and Krashen (2003a).[ 3](text00007.html#fn3)

## **The Effect of Television**

It is widely assumed that watching television has a negative effect on reading and other aspects of language. There are at least two commonsense arguments against television. First, watching TV takes time, time that could be spent reading (this is known as the “displacement argument”). The evidence, we will see, is not clear.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *It is widely assumed that television has a negative effect on reading. Not so.*

A second argument against television is that TV programs do not provide the kind of input that would stimulate language development. According to the research, this assertion is true: TV language is not nearly as complex as book language. Nevertheless, a moderate amount of TV watching appears to be harmless; studies show no significant impact of TV watching on tests of literacy and school performance, unless the amount of TV watching is excessive.

### Does More Television Mean Less Reading?

The view that television watching displaces reading is a popular one, and a few case histories appear to support it. Some of the college students in Carlsen and Sherrill (1988) blamed television for preventing them from becoming readers and, in the following case, for extinguishing their interest in reading: “I continued this avid interest in reading until I was in the fifth grade. Then the one-eyed monster, commonly known as television, entered the realms of our living room…. To say the least, the television set replaced any book” (p. 138).

Some empirical studies appear to support this observation: In a study of sixth graders, Medrich, Roizen, Rubin and Buckley (1982) reported that high-volume TV watchers were less likely to be regular recreational readers than those who were moderate watchers, who in turn read less than those who were low-volume watchers. Amount of TV watching, however, is related to socioeconomic class, with lower-income families watching signifi-cantly more television (research reviewed in Comstock and Paik 1991). As we have seen, those in lower-income families have far less access to books. Thus, the correlation between TV watching and book reading may be spurious, a result of the fact that those in poorer families watch more TV and have less access to books. Access to books could be the actual cause of less frequent reading, not more TV. This interpretation is consistent with other studies showing no relationship between TV watching and reading, reviewed below.

When television is new, it can displace reading. This effect occurs when TV is initially introduced into a community (Brown, Cramond, and Wilde 1974) and when viewers are very young (preschoolers in Burton, Calonico, and McSeveney 1979; six-year-olds in Gadberry 1980). Some early studies done when television was just introduced in the United States also showed that TV watchers read less (Coffin 1948; Maccoby 1951) as did a survey carried out in 1965–1966 of the impact of TV in 14 countries (Robinson 1972).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *When television is new, it can displace reading. When it is more established, it does not.*

When television is more established in a community, TV viewers read just as much as nonviewers, however (Himmelweit, Oppenheim, and Vince 1958), and subsequent studies done in the United States show no relationship between television watching and book reading (Schramm, Lyle, and Parker 1961; Robinson 1980; Zuckerman, Singer, and Singer 1980; but see McEvoy and Vincent 1980, who found no difference in TV watching between “light” and “heavy” readers but reported that “nonreaders” watched more television). Robinson and Godbey (1997) reported an increase in TV watching from 1965 to 1985 in the United States but also reported a slight increase in time spent reading books and magazines; newspaper reading, however, declined during this time.[ 4](text00007.html#fn4)

In an ethnographic study of three families, Neuman (1995) concluded that TV watching was much less likely to displace storybook reading to children when storybook time was “a structured family activity” (p. 168), taking place regularly at aspecific time. TV watching, she noted, was often a default activity, taking place “because it happens to be there when other, even possibly more attractive, activities are not” (p. 170).

Some studies suggest that television can actually encourage reading: The dramatization of a book on television increases the likelihood that the book will be read (Himmelweit, Oppenheim, and Vince 1958; Busch 1978; Wendelin and Zinck 1983; Campbell, Griswald, and Smith 1988). The Book Industry Study Group (1984, cited in Neuman 1995, p. 103) reported, however, than only 4 percent of children they studied chose a book on the basis of seeing or hearing about it on television. It is also possible that television does not increase all reading, but “redirects the existing reading choice of an audience” (Beentjes and Van der Voort 1988, p. 392).

It has also been argued that television discourages reading and other uses of literacy because television characters are rarely seen reading or writing, or even behaving as if they read and write. As Postman (1983) has pointed out:

It is quite noticeable that the majority of adults on TV shows are depicted as functionally illiterate, not only in the sense that the content of book learning is absent from what they appear to know but also because of the absence of even the faintest signs of a contemplative habit of mind, (p. 12)

### The Language of Television

There is some basis for the second accusation presented at the beginning of this section: Televi-sion does not provide high-quality linguistic input.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Television does not provide high-quality linguistic input.*

Fasick (1973) reported that the language used in children’s books was significantly more complicated than the language used in children’s television shows. For example, 64 percent of the sentences in books (five books recommended for reading aloud to preschool children) were “complex,” compared to 34 percent for television (“Captain Kangaroo” and two cartoons). Moreover, the complex sentences found in books involved more subordination. In other words, the complex sentences of the books were more complex. Fasick concluded that the language of television was only about as complicated as the speech of average fifth graders.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The language of children’s books is more complex than that of children’s television.*

Liberman (1979) analyzed the language used in programs popular in the 1970s. His analysis of sentence complexity is in close agreement with Fasick’s results. In addition, Liberman also reported that the quantity of language used on television was low. Of the eight shows Liberman analyzed, the one using the largest number of words, *M.A.S.H.,* contained a total of 3,395 words, and only 900 different words.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The quantity of language used on television is low.*

Liberman concluded that “very likely, the lexicon of TV programming is under 5,000 words” (1979, p. 604), a pathetic result when one considers that estimates of first graders’ vocabulary size range from 5,500 to 32,000 words (Smith 1941). Liberman’s conclusions are supported by Hayes and Ahrens (1988), a study we discussed in [chapter 2 ](text00006.html#ha21). Recall that Hayes and Ahrens found that the lan-guage of TV and ordinary conversation, whether between adults and adults or adults and children, was similar in terms of vocabulary. For all three, about 95 percent of the words used were from the most frequent 5,000 words in English. Printed texts, including comic books, children’s books, and magazines, contained far more uncommon words.

Television shows may provide some input of value for young children in early stages of language acquisition (Rice and Haight 1986). They do not, however, compare very well to reading, either in terms of the complexity or the amount of language they provide.

### Television and Language Development

The impact of television on school-related measures, including reading comprehension, vocabulary, spelling, and “language arts,” has been thoroughly studied. Several careful reviews of this research have been done (Williams, Haertel, Haertel, and Walberg 1982; Beentjes and Van der Voort 1988; Comstock and Paik 1991; Neuman 1995; see also studies by Neuman 1988 and Foertsch 1992), and they arrive at similar conclusions:

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *The impact of TV on reading is negative only when TV watching is excessive.*

- The overall impact of television is negative, but slight. In fact, it is hardly detectable. No matter what measures of achievement are examined, more television watching means only slightly reduced performance in reading comprehension, vocabulary, and other school-related measures.
- Several studies find that achievement actually increases (slightly) with moderate amounts of TV watching; that is, the more TV, the better watchers do on school-related tests. The relationship holds only up to about two hours of TV per day. After reaching this threshold, the relationship is negative: The more TV, the worse watchers do, with TV watching showing a clearly nega-tive impact when it exceeds four hours per day (see, e.g., Neuman 1988, 1995). Interestingly, increased television watching is associated with better literacy development for children acquiring English as a second language (Blosser 1988); this relationship did not hold true for beginners, however, for whom English-language television was probably not comprehensible.
- There is some evidence that television has more negative effects on older students (high school; Neuman 1988) and on those in higher socioeconomic classes (Beentjes and Van der Voort 1988), but the impact remains small. Also, as one would expect, there is evidence that the impact of television depends on what programs children watch, with lower achievement related to watching entertainment-type and adventure programs (Neuman 1988).[ 5](text00007.html#fn5)

In general, however, correlations between what is watched and reading achievement are very modest (Degrotsky 1981; Potter 1987); the only substantial correlation reported by Potter (1987) was a negative relationship between watching soap operas and knowledge of science. Jönsson (1986), however, reported that preschool children whose parents “helped them to assimilate and understand television messages and kept a check on their televiewing” (p. 32) did better in school later on, and fifth graders who watched more documentaries did better in grade six.

### Television: A Summary

Much of what is on television may not be of high quality; nevertheless, television is clearly not the culprit in the “literacy crisis.” Although the language of many TV shows is not impressive, there is no clear evidence that TV displaces reading, and there is only a weak negative relationship between TV watching and performance on school-related tests. In fact, a little TV watching appears to be better than none at all, and TV watching may be helpful for second language acquisition. It is only when television watching is excessive that a clear negative effect appears, what Trelease (2001) refers to as “over-viewing” of TV.

Phrased slightly differently, it seems that those who do better on tests of language and literacy read more, but watch TV only a little less. Apparently it is not the presence of television that prevents children from reading; more likely, it is the absence of interesting books. Corteen and Williams (1986) agree: Consistent with the results of other studies, they found a negative correlation between amount of TV watching and reading achievement, but the size of the relationship was small, and they conclude that “the absence of reading practice is, in our view, more important than television” (p. 71).[ 6](text00007.html#fn6)

A final bit of data confirms this conclusion. Neuman (1995) compared the book choices of children who were heavy readers and heavy TV watchers, heavy readers and light TV watchers, and light readers and heavy TV watchers. The first two groups chose books of equally high quality (according to a scale measuring intellectual challenge, complexity, and richness of ideas), and both groups of heavy readers chose books of higher quality than the light readers. TV watching does not displace reading, nor does it mean lower-quality reading.

## **Second Language Acquirers**

When second language acquirers read for pleasure, they develop the competence to move from the beginning “ordinary conversational” level to a level where they can use the second language for more demanding purposes, such as the study of literature, business, and so on. As some of the studies discussed earlier in this volume show, when second language acquirers read for pleasure, they can continue to improve in their second language without classes, without teachers, without study, and even without people to converse with (e.g., Clio’s Sweet Valley studies, discussed in [chapter 2](text00006.html#ha21)).

There are also compelling reasons for encouraging recreational reading in the first language for second language acquirers. In early stages, it can profoundly accelerate the development of reading ability in the second language.

First, if it is true that we “learn to read by reading” (Goodman 1982; Smith 1994b), it is obviously easier to learn to read in a language the reader understands. Thus, it will be easier to learn to read in the primary language. Once the ability to read is acquired, there is good evidence that much of this ability transfers to the second language, even when the writing systems are different (Cummins 1981). There is strong correlational evidence supporting this hypothesis, as well as compelling case histories (Krashen 2003c).

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Learning to read in the first language is a short cut to second language reading.*

Second, as discussed in [chapter 1 ](text00005.html#ha1), reading provides knowledge, knowledge of the world as well as subject matter knowledge. The knowledge gained through the first language can make second language input much more comprehensible.

Third, there is reason to suspect that the plea-sure reading habit itself transfers. A pleasure reader in the first language will become a pleasure reader in the second language (Camiciottoli 2001).

Evidence confirming that reading in the first language is helpful for second language acquisition comes from the documented success of bilingual programs that provide literacy development and subject matter teaching in the primary language. Such programs, it has been shown, teach English as well as or better than programs in which children are taught in English all day (for reviews, see Willig 1985; Greene 1997. An especially complete recent study is Oller and Eilers 2002).

Recreational reading can also be of tremendous help for those who wish to continue to develop their primary or “heritage” language (HL). Contrary to popular opinion, it is very difficult to continue to develop one’s primary language while living in another country. The most obvious barrier is lack of input; if one only uses the heritage language at home, there are of course limits to how far one can develop the language. Other barriers are less obvious, but are powerful: There is evidence that some heritage language speakers go through a stage of rejection or avoidance of the heritage culture (Tse 1998) and may avoid using the heritage language. Those in this stage of “ethnic ambivalence/evasion” will not improve their heritage language competence, regardless of whether input is available or not. Finally, some imperfect heritage language speakers report that their efforts to use the language are met with correction and even ridicule by more competent HL speakers, a reaction that discourages the use of the HL (Gupta and Yeok 1995; Krashen 1998b).

A big part of the solution for those lacking input or facing ridicule is a method that supplies in-put and works for shy people: recreational reading. Several studies confirm that recreational reading works for heritage language development: Tse (2001) reported that those who “beat the odds” and managed to maintain unusually high levels of competence in their heritage language had access to reading materials in the heritage language, and nearly all developed an interest in reading in the language for pleasure. Cho and Krashen (2000) found four independent predictors of HL competence among second-generation Korean HL speakers: parental use of the HL, trips to Korea, TV watching, and recreational reading. McQuillan (1998b) reported that Spanish classes at the university of level for native speakers of Spanish that emphasized pleasure reading and discussion of texts of interest resulted in more enthusiasm for Spanish reading as well as better gains in vocabulary, as compared to traditional instruction.

It is easy to say that recreational reading in the primary language can be a big help, but there is a major barrier that prevents implementation: little access to books. A huge percentage of limited English speaking children in the United States are Spanish-speakers. As noted in [chapter 2 ](text00006.html#ha21), Spanish speaking limited English proficient children have very little access to books in Spanish, at home (Ramirez et al. 1991) or in school (Pucci 1994).[ 7](text00007.html#fn7)

## **Conclusions**

My conclusions are simple. When children read for pleasure, when they get “hooked on books,” they acquire, involuntarily and without conscious effort, nearly all of the so-called language skills many people are so concerned about: They will become adequate readers, acquire a large vocabulary, develop the ability to understand and use complex grammatical constructions, develop a good writing style, and become good (but not nec-essarily perfect) spellers. Although free voluntary reading alone will not ensure the attainment of the highest levels of literacy, it will at least ensure an acceptable level. It will also provide the competence necessary for dealing with demanding texts.[ 8 ](text00007.html#fn8)Without it, I suspect that children simply do not have a chance.

When we read, we really have no choice—we must develop literacy. We rarely find well-read people who have serious problems with grammar, spelling, and so on. They write acceptably well because they can’t help it; they have subconsciously acquired good writing style as well as all or nearly all of the conventions of writing.

I am not, however, proposing a language arts program consisting only of free reading. I also recognize the value of reading that is assigned by teachers, and reading that is recommended by teachers, librarians, and parents. A language arts class, in my view, is primarily a literature class. Assigned reading and free voluntary reading will help each other: Through literature, students will grow intellectually and be exposed to a wider variety of books, which can stimulate more free reading. In fact, one of the ways we know that a literature program is effective is if it results in more free voluntary reading. In turn, free voluntary reading will help build language competence and contribute to intellectual growth, which will make literature more comprehensible and meaningful.

Our problem in language education, as Frank Smith has pointed out, is that we have confused cause and effect. We have assumed that we first master language “skills” and then apply these skills to reading and writing. But that is not the way the human brain operates. Rather, reading for meaning, reading about things that matter to us, is the cause of literate language development.

If this view is even partly correct, it means that we need to create a print-rich environment for children both inside and outside school. It means that teachers need to be assured that creating such an environment will make their jobs easier, not harder, and will give more satisfying results.

Administrators need to know that when teachers are reading to students, and when teachers are relaxing with a good book during sustained silent reading sessions, teachers are doing their job. Administrators need to know that a print-rich environment is not a luxury but a necessity. (Administrators will be relieved to know that creating a print-rich environment is not excessively expensive: For the price of a few computers, a school library can be significantly improved.) Administrators will also be pleased to know that providing a print-rich environment will lead to an easier and more productive day for teachers, with improved student competence in reading and language arts, competence that shows up in real life as well as on standardized test scores.

Parents need to know that children will get far more benefit from being read to, from seeing parents read for pleasure, and from reading comics, graphic novels, magazines, and books, than they will from working through workbooks on sale at the local drug store.

![img](http://localhost:8000/b62cb1dd-9098-4a21-b8e1-bea52947b2e4/OEBPS/Image00003.jpg) *Parents should opt for actual reading rather than using workbooks.*

Finally, there is no question that reading is pleasant; as we have seen, the research literature is replete with reports of the pleasure children get from free reading (see [chapter 1 ](text00005.html#ha1), “The Pleasure of Reading” section), as well as the boredom that often accompanies some required reading and work-book exercises. While it may not be true that everything that is good for you is pleasant, the most effective way of building literacy happens to be the most pleasant.

## **Notes**

[1. ](text00007.html#ft1)The Smith-Goodman view of reading as the confirmation of predictions has been challenged. For discussion and a response to some critics, see Krashen (1999).

[2. ](text00007.html#ft2)Smith’s hypothesis explains why some of us cannot seem to write convincingly in certain styles, despite massive reading of texts written in these styles. I have read widely, but seem only to be able to write comfortably in the academic (or at best modified academic) style you are reading now, reflecting the club I have joined. (I have been told that even my personal letters read like journal papers.) Smith’s hypothesis also explains, conversely, why reading just a modest amount of authors we admire can influence our writing style.

[3. ](text00007.html#ft3)Strong confirmation that writing helps thinking is the work of Robert Boice. Boice (1983) concluded that regularly scheduled writing sessions encouraged more writing and the emergence of more creative ideas than did “spontaneous” writing (writing when the writer “felt like it”). Boice asked college students to write under several conditions: not to write at all for several weeks (control group), to write only when they felt like it, or to write regularly at scheduled sessions each day. Subjects were asked to keep track of the number of pages written and the number of creative or novel ideas they came up with. Regular daily writing resulted in about double the number of pages written and double the number of new ideas, as compared to writing when one felt like it. The con-trol group reported the fewest number of new ideas. Boice has recommended a modest amount of regular daily writing in several of his publications (see especially Boice 1994). There is no doubt in my mind that it works. I would never have completed this edition of this book without following Boice’s suggestions.

[4. ](text00007.html#ft4)There is some evidence supporting the reasonable hypothesis that what children watch is related to how much they read. In agreement with other research, Zuckerman, Singer, and Singer (1980) found no overall relationship between time spent watching TV and time spent reading, but they also found that children who watched more “fantasy violent” programs tended to read less. Schramm, Lyle, and Parker (1961) also reported no relation between TV watching and book reading, but found that children who watch more TV read fewer comic books (see also Murray and Kippax 1978 for similar results; Williams and Boyes 1986, however, found a slight positive correlation between TV watching and comic book reading).

[5. ](text00007.html#ft5)This is consistent with research showing that children who watch more “violent fantasy” programs do less reading, as mentioned in note 4. Cleary (1939) found that the impact of radio in the 1930s was remarkably similar to the impact of television today. Cleary concluded that overall, “radio listening does not seriously restrict the amount or quality of reading” (p. 126). Although those who listened to the radio a great deal (more than three hours per day) read fewer books (but read more newspapers and magazines), those who did very little listening to the radio had less interest in read-ing. Cleary also reported that heavy moviegoers, those who attended more than three films per week (5 percent of her sample), read more books and read higher-quality books.

[6. ](text00007.html#ft6)Computer use, contrary to popular opinion, appears to be mildly positively related to reading. Robinson and Godbey (1997) reported positive but small correlations between amount of computer use and time spent reading books for adults: More computer use was associated with more reading. The relationship remained significant even when the researchers controlled for social class; this is important to do because higher-income people are more likely to have computers and to read more. Of great interest is the finding that the relationship also held for different uses of the computer. Time spent word processing, using the computer for financial purposes, and playing games on the computer (!) all correlated positively with time spent reading. Time spent on the computer was negatively correlated with time spent watching TV, but again the relationship was small. The results of a recent Gallup Poll (Gallup 2002) confirmed that computers do not bleed reading time: Those who regularly use computers spend as much time reading as those who do not.

[7. ](text00007.html#ft7)Pucci and Ulanoff (1996) surveyed 32 school librarians: 54 percent said that books written in Spanish were difficult to obtain, and 70 percent said that their cost was “prohibitive.” Of 5,000 books on one approved reading list for purchase for school libraries, only 300 were in Spanish. Pucci and Ulanoff note that “even if these books were age appropriate, a child reading two books per week would finish every Spanish volume in the library before entering fourth grade” (p. 114).

[8. ](text00007.html#ft8)As noted in [chapter 2 ](text00006.html#ha21), note 6, there are clear differences between different genres. But there is overlap: Reading in any genre will help make any other genre more comprehensible. A student about to take ninth-grade world history who has read 100 Sweet Valley High novels will have more success with the history texts than a classmate who has done little or no recreational reading. And one who has read all the Harry Potter novels (five have been published at the time of this writing) will probably have very few problems.
