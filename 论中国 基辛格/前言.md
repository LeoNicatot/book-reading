# 前言 Preface

几乎在40年前的今天，我有幸受理查德·尼克松总统委托访问北京，与这个国家重新建立联系。中国在亚洲历史上居于核心地位，而20多年来美国与其一直没有高层接触。美国打开中国大门的动机是为了走出越南战争的阵痛和冷战的不祥阴影，给美国人民展现一幅和平前景。当时的中国虽然在严格意义上仍是苏联的盟国，但为了抵御来自莫斯科的进攻威胁，北京也在寻求回旋空间。

FORTY YEARS AGO almost to the day, President Richard Nixon **did me the honor of** sending me to Beijing to reestablish contact with a country central to the history of Asia with which America had had no high-level contact for over twenty years. The American motive for the opening was to put before our people a vision of peace **transcending** the **travail** of the Vietnam War and the **ominous** **vistas** of the Cold War. China, though **technically** an ally of the Soviet Union, was **in quest of** **maneuvering** room to resist a threatened attack from Moscow.

此后我先后访问中国达50多次。如同几百年来前往中国的众多访客一样，我日益钦佩中国人民，钦佩他们的坚韧不拔、含蓄缜密、家庭意识和他们展现出的中华文化。与此同时，我终生都在从一个美国人的视角反思如何缔造和平。我很幸运，能够同时以高级官员、信使和学者的身份探寻这两条思路。

In the **interval** I have been to China more than fifty times. Like many visitors over the centuries, I have come to admire the Chinese people, their endurance, their **subtlety**, their family sense, and the culture they represent. At the same time, all my life I have reflected on the building of peace, largely from an American perspective. I have had the good luck of being able to pursue these two **strands** of thinking simultaneously as a senior official, as a carrier of messages, and as a scholar.

本书部分依据与中国领导人的谈话，试图解释中国人对战争与和平、国际秩序等问题的理性思考，以及这种思考与美国人更为实用的、就事论事的思维方式的关系。两国由于在历史和文化上的差异，有时会得出迥异的结论。我并非总是认同中国人的观点，读者亦然。但我们有必要了解这些观点，因为中国将在21世纪的世界中发挥重大作用。

This book is an effort, based in part on conversations with Chinese leaders, to explain the **conceptual** way the Chinese think about problems of peace and war and international order, and its relationship to the more pragmatic, **case-by-case** American approach. Different histories and cultures produce **occasionally** divergent conclusions. I do not always agree with the Chinese perspective, nor will every reader. But it is necessary to understand it, since China will play such a big role in the world that is emerging in the twenty-first century.

> 1. conceptual：**ADJ**概念的;观念的
> 2. case-by-case：逐一
> 3. occasional：**ADJ-GRADED**偶尔的；间或的；有时发生的

自从我首次访华之后，中国已经成为一个经济超级大国和塑造全球政治秩序的重要力量。美国赢得了冷战，中美关系成为争取世界和平与全球福祉的核心要素。

Since my first visit, China has become an economic superpower and a major factor in shaping the global political order. The United States has **prevailed** in the Cold War. The relationship between China and the United States has become a **central element** in the quest for world peace and global well-being.

> 1. prevail：**VERB**（提议、原则、观点）占上风，占优势，获胜，被接受**VERB**（在战斗、竞赛、争论中）获胜，取胜**VERB**（情形、态度、风俗）盛行，流行，普遍	

尽管两国的出发点迥异，八位美国总统和四代中国领导人在处理微妙的双边关系时却显示了惊人的连贯性。双方始终尽力维护这一实质性的合作关系，使之不受历史纠葛和各自国内考虑的干扰。

Eight American presidents and four generations of Chinese leaders have managed this delicate relationship in an astonishingly consistent manner, considering the difference in starting points. Both sides have refused to permit historic **legacies** or different conceptions of domestic order to interrupt their essentially cooperative relationship.

> 1. legacy：**N-COUNT**（事件或历史的）遗留问题，后遗症
>
>    A **legacy of** an event or period of history is something which is a direct result of it and which continues to exist after it is over.

这是一段复杂的历程，因为中国和美国都认为自己代表独特的价值观。美国的**例外主义**是传经布道式的，认为美国有义务向世界的每个角落传播其价值观。中国的例外主义是文化性的，中国不试图改变他国的信仰，不对海外推行本国的现行体制。但它是中央帝国的传承者，根据其他国家与中国文化和政治形态的亲疏程度将它们正式划分为不同层次的“进贡国”。换言之，这是一种文化上的普世观。

> 例外主义：例外论（英语：Exceptionalism），又称例外主义、特殊主义，一种理论与意识形态，凡是认为某个国家、地区、社会、民族、组织、社会运动或历史时期，具备特殊的性质，以致于无法被一般性的理论或规则所解释，就可称为例外论。在各国社会中，这是一个常见的论点，在美国有美国例外论，在中国也有类似思想，称为中国例外主义。 

It has been a complex journey, for both societies believe they represent unique values. American **exceptionalism** is **missionary**. It holds that the United States has an obligation to spread its values to every part of the world. China’s exceptionalism is cultural. China does not **proselytize**; it does not claim that its contemporary institutions are relevant outside China. But it is the **heir** of the Middle Kingdom tradition, which formally graded all other states as various levels of tributaries based on their approximation to Chinese cultural and political forms; in other words, a kind of cultural **universality**.

> 1. exceptionalism
> 2. missionary：**ADJ**传教的;布道的**N-COUNT**(派往国外的)传教士
> 3. proselytize[ˈprɒsələtaɪz]：**VERB**使改变宗教（或政治）信仰
> 4. heir[eə(r)]：**N-COUNT**继承人
> 5. universality：**N-COUNT**普遍原则；通用原理

本书主要讲述了自从1949年中华人民共和国成立后中美两国领导人之间的相互交往。无论是在政府任职期间还是离开政府之后，我一直保存着与四代中国领导人的谈话记录，这是我写作本书的第一手资料。

A primary focus of this book is the interaction between Chinese and American leaders since the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949. Both in and out of government, I have kept records of my conversations with four generations of Chinese leaders and have drawn on them as a primary source in writing this book.

如果不仰赖同事和朋友的辛勤努力和大力协助，我不可能写出这本书。

This book could not have been written without the dedicated and **able** assistance of associates and of friends who permitted me to **impose on** them for help.

> 1. impose on：**VERB**把…硬加给;把…强塞给;勉强(某人)做事
> 2. able：**ADJ-GRADED**聪明能干的；能力出众的

斯凯勒·斯考滕是一个不可或缺的助手。8年前，耶鲁大学教授约翰·加迪斯把他这位得意门生推荐给我，我与斯凯勒就此相识。开始这个项目时，我让他请两个月假，暂时放下他的律师事务所工作。他答应了，并在整个过程中付出了大量精力和时间，直到一年后善始善终地完成这件事。斯凯勒承担了大量的基础研究工作，帮助我翻译了中文文献，深入揣摩了一些微妙语句的含义，还不知疲倦地帮我编辑和校对。我从未遇到过如此优秀的研究助手，也很少有人能出其右。

Schuyler Schouten was indispensable. He came to my attention eight years ago when Professor John Gaddis of Yale recommended him as one of his ablest students. When I started this project I asked him to take a two-month leave from his law firm. He did so, and in the process became so involved that he saw the effort through to its end a year later. Schuyler undertook much of the basic research. He helped with the translation of Chinese texts and even more with **penetrating** the implications of some of the subtler ones. He was **indefatigable** during the editing and proofreading phase. I have never had a better research associate and very rarely one as good.

> 2. indefatigable

在我10年来的所有活动中，斯特凡妮·荣格–莫特都与我并肩工作，实在是我的大幸。她是棒球比赛中被称为全能选手的人，既作研究，又从事编辑工作，还是我与出版商之间的主要联系人。她帮助协调录入工作，并在交稿期限临近时毫无保留地鼎力相助。她的魅力和外交技巧使她的贡献更显重要。

It has been my good fortune to have Stephanie Junger-Moat work with me for a decade across the **gamut** of my activities. She was what in baseball they would call the essential utility player. She did research and some editing, and was the principal **liaison** with the publisher. She checked all the endnotes. She helped coordinate the typing and never hesitated to pitch in when deadlines approached. Her crucial contribution was reinforced by her charm and diplomatic skill.

我的老友哈里·埃文斯30年前编辑了《白宫岁月》，这次又不负重托，审阅了本书的全部书稿，就全书的文字和结构提出了许多极好的建议。

Harry Evans edited *White House Years* thirty years ago. He permitted me to impose on our friendship to go over the entire manuscript. His editorial and structural suggestions were numerous and wise.

特里莎·阿曼泰亚和乔迪·威廉斯一遍又一遍地录入文稿，牺牲了许多夜晚和周末，在最后时限之前完成了任务。他们的激情、高效和慧眼至关重要。

Theresa Amantea and Jody Williams typed the manuscript many times over and spent many evenings and weekends helping meet deadlines. Their good cheer, efficiency, and sharp eye for detail were vital.

前驻华大使、著名中国问题学者芮效俭，打开中国大门时的同事、后来的驻华大使温斯顿·洛德和我的遗嘱保管人迪克·菲茨阅读过部分章节，并作出了睿智的评论。乔恩·范登·霍伊维尔对书中几章的研究工作提供了帮助。

Stapleton Roy, former ambassador to China and distinguished China scholar; Winston Lord, my associate during the opening to China and later ambassador to China; and Dick Viets, my literary executor, read several chapters and made insightful comments. Jon Vanden Heuvel provided helpful research on several chapters.

与企鹅出版社合作是一段令人愉快的经历。安·戈多夫随叫随到，眼光独到，从不添乱，让人乐于与之相处。布鲁斯·吉福德、诺伊琳·卢卡斯和托里·克洛斯熟练地指导了本书的编辑加工。弗雷德·蔡斯最后对书稿进行了细致高效的文字校对，以交付排版。劳拉·斯蒂克尼是本书的责任编辑，她年轻得简直可以做我的孙女，但丝毫不畏惧我这个作者。她毫无保留地对我的政治观点发表看法，我甚至有些盼望看到页边空白处她一贯锐利，偶尔甚至是尖刻的评论。她孜孜不倦，感觉敏锐，给我帮了大忙。

Publishing with The Penguin Press was a happy experience. Ann Godoff was always available, ever insightful, never harassing, and fun to be with. Bruce Giffords, Noirin Lucas, and Tory Klose expertly shepherded the book through the editorial production process. Fred Chase copyedited the manuscript with care and efficiency. Laura Stickney was the book’s principal editor. Young enough to be my granddaughter, she was in no way intimidated by the author. She overcame her reservations about my political views sufficiently that I came to look forward to her occasionally acerbic and always incisive comments in the margins of the manuscript. She was indefatigable, perceptive, and vastly helpful.

对所有这些人，我深为感激。

To all these people I am immensely grateful.

我所引用的政府文件都已经解密一段时间了。我尤其感谢伍德罗·威尔逊国际学者中心“冷战国际史项目”允许我使用俄罗斯和中国文件解密档案的大量章节。卡特图书馆慷慨地让我使用卡特总统时期美中领导人的许多谈话记录，里根图书馆也从他们的档案中提供了大量有用的文件。

The governmental papers on which I drew have all been declassified for some time. I would like to thank in particular the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Cold War International History Project for permission to use extended excerpts from their archive of declassified Russian and Chinese documents. The Carter Library helpfully made available many of the transcripts of meetings with Chinese leaders during the Carter presidency, and the Reagan Library provided numerous useful documents from their files.

毋庸讳言，本书的瑕疵都应归咎于我本人。

Needless to say, the shortcomings of the book are my own.

半个世纪以来，我的妻子南希为写作时孤独的作者（至少本作者是这样）提供了坚定的精神支持和智力支持。她阅读了多数章节，并提供了无数重要的建议。

As always over half a century, my wife, Nancy, provided her staunch moral and intellectual support amidst the solitude authors (or at least this author) generate around themselves when writing. She read most of the chapters and made innumerable important suggestions.

谨将《论中国》献给安妮特与奥斯卡·德拉伦塔。在他们位于蓬塔卡纳的家中，我开始撰写本书，并在那里收笔。他们的热情好客只是我们友谊的一个体现，这份友谊为我的生活增添了快乐与内涵。

I have dedicated *On China* to Annette and Oscar de la Renta. I started the book in their home in Punta Cana and finished it there. Their hospitality has been only one facet of a friendship that has added joy and depth to my life.

## Note on Chinese Spellings

THIS BOOK MAKES frequent reference to Chinese names and terms. Well-known alternative spellings exist for many Chinese words, based on two particularly widespread methods of transliterating Chinese characters into the Roman alphabet: the Wade-Giles method, prevalent through much of the world until the 1980s, and the pinyin method, adopted officially in the People’s Republic of China in 1979 and increasingly common in Western and other Asian publications thereafter.

For the most part, this book employs pinyin spellings. For example, the pinyin spelling “Deng Xiaoping” is used rather than the Wade-Giles spelling “Teng H’siao-ping.” Where other, non-pinyin spellings remain significantly more familiar, they are retained for the reader’s convenience. For example, for the name of the ancient military theorist “Sun Tzu,” the traditional spelling is used, rather than the newer pinyin spelling “Sunzi.”

Occasionally, in the interest of achieving consistency throughout the book’s text, quoted references to names originally listed in the Wade-Giles format have been **rendered** in their pinyin spellings. Such changes are further noted in the endnotes. In each case, the underlying Chinese word remains the same; the difference is in the method of rendering the word in the Roman alphabet.
